<h3><a href="model-railway.php">Model Railway</a></h3>
I started my model railway collection in February 2011, and since then I have produced a collection of baseboards, which are laid out with track and scenery and have been electrically wire. The next step will be to make each module slot together and add legs.

<h3><a href="diy.php">DIY</a></h3>
Recent DIY projects have been mainly garden themed: a pergola, a bird table, an arbour, a planting bench. Currently I have no further major projects planned.

<h3><a href="garden.php">Garden</a></h3>
My main gardening time occurs during school holidays when I often do large-scale digging, building, and planting. Jo has the greener fingers though and keeps on top of management of the plants and keeping them alive. Her website about the garden is a work in progress: <a href="http://www.joclarke.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.joclarke.co.uk/</a>

<h3><a href="outdoors.php">Outdoors</a></h3>
I love walking (in mountainous regions - not in so-called 'hills' down south). I love kayaking.

<h3><a href="football.php">Football</a></h3>
From birth I am a <a href="http://www.rovers.co.uk/" target="_blank">Blackburn Rovers</a> fan. I watched them get promoted from the old Division 2, win the Premier League, get relegated, get promoted back to the Premier League, win the League Cup, play in Europe, and get systematically dismantled by <a href="http://venkys-out-of-blackburn-rovers.co.uk/" target="_blank">Venkys</a>. I watched the odd game at Cambridge <a href="http://www.cambridge-united.co.uk/" target="_blank">United</a> and <a href="http://www.cambridgecityfc.com/" target="_blank">City</a> during my University days, before settling in Oxford where I discovered <a href="http://www.oufc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford United</a>. I have been a season ticket holder since 2009.
