<h2>DIY</h2>
Recent DIY projects have been mainly garden themed: a pergola, a bird table, an arbour, a planting bench. Currently I have no further major projects planned.

<h3>Barbeque Trolley</h3>
I designed and built this for my Design Technology: Resistant Materials GCSE. It was my first big woodwork project and I was surprised by how well it turned out. This success encouraged me to continue woodwork for the rest of my life. I got full marks for the project and I still use it today.
<h3>Hamster table</h3>
I built this over a summer holiday while still at school. The outside is made from thick plywood and I chose the size based on a decorative door which B&Q sold. The door has brass hinges and a brass knob and it held upright by magnetic catches. The whole thing is painted with a mahogany finish and is moveable on castors.

<h3>Pergola</h3>
I designed the pergola soon after moving into the new house in Abingdon. I built it over a weekend using PSE timber painted with a light oak stain.

<h3>Planting table</h3>
<h3>Spice racks</h3>
<h3>Raised beds</h3>
<h3>Bird Table</h3>
