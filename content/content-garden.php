<h2>Garden</h2>
My main gardening time occurs during school holidays when I often do large-scale digging, building, and planting. Jo has the greener fingers though and keeps on top of management of the plants and keeping them alive. Her website about the garden is a work in progress: <a href="http://www.joclarke.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.joclarke.co.uk/</a>
