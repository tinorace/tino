<h2>Equipment</h2>
Like most hobbies it is easy to buy cheap equipment to get you going, then later upgrade as you develop an interest in brewing. I have grouped equipment by the different stages in the brewing process.

<h4>Cleaning</h4>
Sterilizing equipment is the key to a good beer. I use VWP cleaner which is a Chlorine-based sterlizing solution. I add 1 teaspoon per gallon to sterlize everything that I use to make the beer. This requires rinsing afterwards. An alternative which I have not tries yet is an oxygen-based sterlizing solution which does not require rinsing so would save time and effort.

<h4>Making wort</h4>
In 2009 I built a small mash tun. The purpose of the mash tun is to extract the sugars and flavours from malted barley by placing in hot water (70&#176;C). The final step is sparging (rinsing the malt with cold water to extract the last possible sugars). The tun is made from a cool box which I have adapted. I used a hole saw to cut a hole for a tap which was sealed using food-grade sealant. The tap is connected to a network of plastic piping
 which has many slits cut into to allow the wort to pass through but preventing passage of the malt. I have tested the tun to check it work, but have yet to make a beer using it. I plan to make a beer using malt which I already have.


<h4>Boiling with hops</h4>
<p>
I was given a Burco boiler by my Dad in 2009. The first time I used this I didn't anticipate that it would boil over, which resulted in the over boil shorting the extension lead it was plugged into and switching off the electricity supply in the house. I haven't made this mistake since! As well as heating water for use in the mash tun, the boiler allows me to boil hops adding bitterness and preservative qualities to the wort. I have done this process once when I used cans of malt extract and boiled hops. This was an IPA and as an example I boiled one type of hop for 1 hour (to preserve) and a different type for 15 minutes at the end (to add a lot of bitterness since it was an IPA).</p>
<p>Hops can be bought as 100g vacuum packed blocks. A typical recipe might require 10g of hops so a pack can last a long time. To maintain freshness the best thing to do is store the hops in the freezer and break off the required amount each time you need it. In 2011 I planted a hop bine in my garden. The variety is Prima Dona and will produce a small number of flowers this year, so 2013 should be the first year I will have hops which I can use in my own brews.

<h4>Fermenting</h4>
<p>
To ferment a beer the wort must be within a specific temperature range: too cold and the fermentation process will not start yet; too hot and the yeast will be killed and fermentation will never start. The correct temperature is around 2470&#176;C and the easiest way to achieve this is by mixing hot and cold water. If you are making a 40 pint beer kit you would usually add 3.5L of boiled water and top up the remainder with cold water. If you have just boiled your wort yourself then you can either wait for the liquid to cool, or you can use a cooling coil to speed up the process. I have a coil made from copper (which has high thermal conductivity). This connections via a hose pipe to a tap; in one end goes cold water and out the other end come warmer water, cooling the liquid in less than half an hour.

<p>
You can buy plastic fermenting buckets very cheaply. Once at the correct temperature all that remains is to add yeast. While techinically you could add any type of yeast it is better to buy a specific yeast for the drink you are making to ensure fermentation is complete. You can use a hygrometer to record the specific gravity (SG) of the liquid which will help you work out the exact abv of your final product. Fermentation usually takes between 4-6 days, but leave for longer if necessary. You will know fermentation is fully complete when no more bubbles are produced and the SG remains constant, below 1.090 for a day or two.

<h4>Storage</h4>
You have two options here: barrels or bottles. I have 4 kegs which means I always have 2 available to drink and 2 maturing. In 2012 I was given 5 crates filled with empty beer bottles so I have started bottling as well. I only drink the bottles when I am away from home as it is a lot of effort to do the bottling. Another reason for bottling is that the beer benefits from it (for example a continental pilsner which tastes better when bottled due to increased fizz). Whichever you go for, just syphon from the primary fermenting barrel into your chosen vessel, then add brewing sugar (fructose). Add either half a teaspoon per bottle/pint, or add 85g to a 40 pint keg. This allows secondary fermentation to happen, which adds bubbles and improves the taste of the beer. You will need to leave for a minimum of 2 weeks. Some beers benefit from a little longer, others such as some cider kits need 3 months before they taste at their best.
