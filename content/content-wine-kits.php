	<h2>Home brewing: Wine kits</h2>

From experience I have found there is more that can go wrong with wine kits, however they usually do produce good results and I usually produce decent tasting wines.
 The main things that can spoil a wine kit can be prevented by sterlising equipment properly, stopping fermentation, and ensuring the wine is fully degassed and settled before bottling. The process requires a bit more TLC than beer kits, takes longer and produces less volume.

<ol>
<li>Clean the fermenting bucket with sterlising powder and rinse</li>
<li>Pour malt extract from the kit into the bucket</li>
<li>Add 3.5L of boiling water, then fill with cold water until up to 5 gallons (40 pints)</li>
<li>Stir then add yeast sachet</li>
<li>Leave for 7 days until fermentation has stopped (no more bubbles are produced)</li>
<li>Siphon into a pressure barrel or pint bottles</li>
<li>Add 1/2 teaspoon of brewers sugar per pint (or a max of 85g)</li>
<li>Seal keg/cap bottles and leave for at least 2 weeks before drinking</li>
</ol>

<h3>Wine kit reviews</h3>
<h4>Young's Fruit wines</h4>
<p>
Young's fruit wines can be bought for around £5 and make six bottles of wine. I buy from either Wilkinson's which usually stock at least 6 of this range, or <a href="www.stonehelm.co.uk" target="blank">Stonehelm</a> where they are always fully stocked. There are a range of flavours, of which I have made peach, elderberry, elderflower, strawberry, black cherry, and blackberry. They taste like the fruit they claim to be, though are never too sickly or sweet. They have become my favourite kits as you can easily buy a cheap bottle of standard red or white wine in a supermarket, but it is extremely rare to be able to find an economical fruit wine in shops. They tend to only be sold at £8 upwards and not available on the mass market. They are lovely chilled and drunk on their own or with a light dish, such pastas and pizzas.

<h4>Young's wines</h4>
<p>
Young's also produce standard reds and white. They are cheaper than other brands, though do not come with as many chemicals to clear the wine and improve taste. This can be remedied by buying quantities of the chemicals you need and adding them at the same stage you would add them to a more expensive kit.

<h4>California Connoisseur</h4>
<p>
The first wine kits I ever made, there are the usual range of grape varieties available. In whites, there is Chardonnay-Semillon, French Colombard, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc. Reds include Barolo, Cabernet Sauvinon, Pinot Noir. Rose varieties are Zinfandel Blush. They come with all the chemicals you could want to add to your wines, and produce a decent wine which is best drunk young.
