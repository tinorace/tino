<h2>Home brewing: Beer Kits</h2>

If you are starting out home brewing, then making a beer kit is by far the easiest way to start. The minimum you would need to make your first beer is a fermenting bucket (25L), a keg or bottles, syphon tubing, sterilising powder and of course a beer kit. Making the kit is a simple process.

<ol>
<li>Clean the fermenting bucket with sterlising powder and rinse</li>
<li>Pour malt extract from the kit into the bucket</li>
<li>Add 3.5L of boiling water, then fill with cold water until up to 5 gallons (40 pints)</li>
<li>Stir then add yeast sachet</li>
<li>Leave for 7 days until fermentation has stopped (no more bubbles are produced)</li>
<li>Siphon into a pressure barrel or pint bottles</li>
<li>Add 1/2 teaspoon of brewers sugar per pint (or a max of 85g)</li>
<li>Seal keg/cap bottles and leave for at least 2 weeks before drinking</li>
</ol>
