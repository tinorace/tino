<h2>Football</h2>
From birth I am a <a href="http://www.rovers.co.uk/" target="_blank">Blackburn Rovers</a> fan. I watched them get promoted from the old Division 2, win the Premier League, get relegated, get promoted back to the Premier League, win the League Cup, play in Europe, and get systematically dismantled by <a href="http://venkys-out-of-blackburn-rovers.co.uk/" target="_blank">Venkys</a>. I watched the odd game at Cambridge <a href="http://www.cambridge-united.co.uk/" target="_blank">United</a> and <a href="http://www.cambridgecityfc.com/" target="_blank">City</a> during my University days, before settling in Oxford where I discovered <a href="http://www.oufc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford United</a>. I have been a season ticket holder since 2009.
