<h2>Part III Project: Glacial periods in the Late Ordovician: Howgill Fells, England</h2>
<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>This research project was a requirement of the Geology course during my fourth year. I looked at the ___ formation in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howgill_Fells" target="blank">Howgill Fells</a> to look for evidence for glacial periods during the Late Ordovician. My project supervisor was <a href="http://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/nigel-woodcock" target="blank">Nigel Woodcock</a>. I stayed in the Bull Hotel in Sedbergh for 2 weeks at the same time as the Part IB mapping field trip.</p>
