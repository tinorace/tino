	Welcome to my personal website and blog. I am a Physics teacher at <a href="http://www.lordwilliams.oxon.sch.uk" target="blank">Lord Williams's School</a>. Academically I am also interested in Geology (the degree I read at the University of Cambridge) and Computer Science. The latter I have started to take an interest in in the past couple of year, and I am pursuing this through self-learning and online degree courses such as MITx's 6.002x.

My blog covers a wide range of my interests, including football, DIY, home brewing, my travels, as well as my teaching career. I usually add something every other day or so. There are pages dedicated to recording my research and achievements. I have also created areas for each of my interests.

My latest project is <a href="http://www.physicasts.co.uk" target="blank">Physicasts</a>, a podcasting website aimed at helping 14-19 year old revise Physics. I learnt how to make podcasts in May 2012 at a <a href="ict2012.php">teacher training course</a> and made a successful, yet one-off podcast on the back of this. Over the academic year 2012-2013 I will be recording a full series of podcasts, starting with ages 14-16, covering the full GCSE Dual Award Physics course.
