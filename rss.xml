	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford felt like they had won the game after two late comebacks, but the result hide a poor performance and defensive mishaps. The game was tinged with sadness at the news of the death of Mitchell Cole, but there was no minutes silence before the game. Instead OUFC fans gave a minutes applause in the 17th minute of the game. The U's took a relatively early lead. An ok ball down the flank put JP Pittman in a difficult position near the corner flag, but he turned his man beautifully, creating space along the byline. With no defenders blocking his path to goal Rachubka had to come out to face him, but the American took it past him and scored into the empty net. It was one of a few rare moments of class in an otherwise poor game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/pittman.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;JP Pittman's opening goal was a stunning run past the keeper.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stanley drew level in the 25th minute as Oxford failed to deal with aball into the box. Amond should have scored but scuffed it badly. Instead it fell to Craig Lindfield who made no mistake. The contest was very close in the first half as Oxford's best work wa via Pittman and Rigg on the left of the pitch. Oxford finished with the better chances but none of the corners won ended with any decent shots on target. A massive blow for the season and for the game was when Pittman went down holding his shoulder. This sadly looks like it will be a sizeable absence but also weakened our attacking threat. The second disappointment was that Wilder chose to overlook Tyrone Marsh yet again, bringing on Davis to play left mid and moving Rigg up front where he could be less effective.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Damien Batt was introduced at half time and looked sharp and solid. He replaced Lee Cox as Andy Whing moved into a defensive midfield position for all of 2 minutes. As Whing overstretched for the ball in a tackle his knee went. I was worried about how long he would be out for until he got up and started walking. Then my earlier concern was right and he was down again, stretchered off and no doubt out for at least a month or two. So Adam Chapman was introduced and all hope of further tactical changes was gone with the third substitution. The lost of Cox, Pittman, and Whing really upset the drive of the team and we looked significantly poorer without them. There was little passion shown, it was the flatest of flat performances.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Former England international James Beattie had a free header but it was straight at Ryan Clarke. The Oxford stopper made another good save and Oxford were saved by some poor heading in front of goal. It was end to end yet disappointing. There were many goals to come in this second half and it was exciting for these moments but the whole event just wasn't exciting to watch from my point of view. Most of Oxford's impetus was on the left as Potter had a quiet game, but Constable and Rigg were determined to win this on their own. Michael Raynes provided danger from corners.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With 6 minutes left Beattie hit a speculative half volley from some way out and it sliced into the top corner. It was a superb hit if it was meant. Then Beano was put through by Chapman and hit it under Rachubka, 2-2. Davis could have won it but for Stanley's man of the match. Into injury time and Liam Davis lifted his foot high. He won the ball cleanly but the referee decided it was dangerous and it did look like quiet a silly challenge. The wall was placed nicely, but so was the free kick by Molyneux. Although it was curled nicely Ryan Clarke was massively at fault, he was just too central and didn't get across to an easily saveable strike. Let the wall cover one side and the keeper the other. Basics. 2-3. The unbelievable comeback was finished by the yellows as Leven crossed for Raynes to head in. A moment of huge excitement that didn't reflect the first  84 minutes very well. So a replay at the Kassam for a place in the third round. We celebrated this like a win, but a little reality check tells me that this was a subpar performance, and a draw against Accrington is a terrible result. Even game I think we need Wilder Out all that little bit more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Accrington Stanley Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Rachubka, Murphy, Liddle, Nsiala, Winnard, Joyce, Miller, Lindfield [1], (Mingoia 90), Beattie [1] (Gray 84), Amond (Molyneux [1] 68), Boco.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
James Constable had some good chances, scoring the 2nd goal. He looked like he wanted to win this game while others looked less bothered&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;

		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/accrington.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Stanley, vocal in persistence is not numbers, have had a poor run of form at home under Leam Richardson. They exploited some of Oxford's defensive weakness and scored two excellent goals at the end. There were about 16 Stanley fans who were giving United fans stick all throughout the second half and were the subject of some return chants themselves. They were schoolchildren all of about 10 years old.
&lt;/div&gt;

Non-league sides Harrogate, Hastings, Lincoln, Mansfield and Luton all go into the hat for the third round, with the first four having to replay. The only upset was Burton beating League One Crewe.

I drove to Stonehelm on the way home from work, and have added another Christmas ale called Santa's Winter Warmer from Muntons, and a Belgian Abbey Ale using dark candy sugar to provide the classic almost burnt taste. I have made some more wines, peach, gooseberry, and blackberry. The best thing I bought was a new bottle capper. Hitting a metal tool with a hammer 40 times was getting tedious and tiring and I was breaking a bottle or two per batch. Also the capper I had didn't do a good job of sealing properly. I bought a tool called 'Emily' (don't know why its called it), which make the process of capping bottles much simpler and quicker.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford fans were left in a state of shock today: not only did our team win, but they played really well and we enjoyed watching the game. It's been a while hasn't it. Oxford have continued a recent habit of scoring early in games, when Alfie Potter created a bit of space to provide a low and well aimed cross to an unmarked James Constable with a very easy tap in. Another goal to add to his confidence. Northampton made areally good game of it and it was end to end stuff for most of the match. Rigg and Forster-Caskey both created great chances but hit the woodwork.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/pittman.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Jon-Paul Pittman scored for the first time in 10 months.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The pace of the game was good and a real postive for the U's was the improvement in midfield control. The return of Lee Cox was a major factor in this, plus an improvement in the game of Peter Leven who has been poor of late. Oxford lost the lead late on, but only for three minutes. A chip into the box was headed by Platt who was not marked well enough. The Cobblers were silenced when JP Pittman scored the winning goal. Whatever form Leven is in, he is usually always good for an assist, leading the way for this stat despite limited appearances this season. Another excellent long ball was picked up by the American striker who took a touch then rifled it inside the near post. To add to the travellers' misery veteran Clarke Carlisle was sent of for a cheap second yellow, succumbing to mistiming a challenge on Alfie Potter who was causing problems on the right wing after he dropped back then when Pittman replaced Forster-Caskey. All in all a top quality performance, but still only 18th, still 7 points off the playoffs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Capaldi, Raynes, Wright, Whing, Rigg (Worley 83), Forster-Caskey (Pittman 56 [1]), Cox, Leven, Potter, Constable [1].&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Capaldi, Forster-Caskey. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Northampton Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Nicholls, Langmead, Tozer, East, Carlisle, Demontagnac (Platt 61 [1]), Harding, Hackett, Hornby, Akinfenwa, Robinson.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Langmead, Carlisle, Domntagnac, Robinson. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; Carlisle. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/cox.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Lee Cox seemed to bolster the midfield and we were strong in this area where we have found ourselve overrun in November.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/northampton.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Northampton arrived at the Kassam undefeated in November, and the back of three straight wins. This form  lifted them to one point shy of the playoffs before the game. They provided a good opponent and made the game very entertaining. As time ticked away Northampton got more frustrated when Oxford were in possession and this showed in the high number of yellow cards picked up (one short of an FA fine). Tackles were rash and sometimes downright dirty. Akinfenwa held up the ball very effectively and I think most sides in the league would love to have him in their team, but he was ineffective when it came to shooting today.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/competitions/npower-league-two.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Dagenham contributed to Fleetwood's recent poor form. Rotherham moved above Exeter with a win at St James's Park. Port Vales reduced the gap from Gillingham to two points.	Bradford and Bristol Rovers shared a 3-3 draw despite being at opposite ends of the table, Bradford coming from behind an amazing three times.
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div id='attendance'&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div id='competition'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/competitions/npower-league-two.jpg'/&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford United threw away a lead at Underhill tonight to extend a season of underperforamance and failure to meet expectations. It was a rainy evening in North London but Oxford fans numbered 500 of the 1626 crowd. The match had a lively opening 20 minutes with boths sides having the chances they should have scored, more so Barnet. After only 4 minutes a corner was conceded by United and the inevitable happened. Once a again a yellow shirt failed to win a header in either box and Jake Hyde got under the ball. His header looped over Ryan Clarke into the far corner. Wilder recently deflected criticism of this aspect of our performances (with a typically anti-fans comment), his team does practice corners in training. Of this I have no doubt. Whether the coaching staff have any good ideas on ways to defend wide balls, I have severe doubts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Less than a minute later the visitors were celebrating as Oxford's high pressure lead to Constable knocking down for Rigg in the penalty area who fired home to equalise. Oxford continued to have the better of the game and look comfortable, except for when Barnet countered. Too many crosses were allowed, but only poor finishing and bad luck kept the score at 1-1.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second half had the perfect start as the U's won a free kick which was crossed in by Peter Leven. Andy Whing thundered the header into the goal, off the underside of the crossbar. At 2-1 this should have been game over as Barnet looked capable of giving away more goals. But now the game began to slip from Oxford's control. Barnet claimed more possession for themselves, Kamdjo dominating the middle, while Chapman and certainly Leven began to look absent. Heslop was replaced on the hour mark by JP Pittman, with Alfie Potter dropping back from support striker to right wing in a 4-4-2. This change seemed to take us further out of the game as Heslop was playing reasonably well. Forster-Caskey has the popularity of a player who had just slept with the manager's wife. He was overlooked as our midfield was being overrun. Tyrone Marsh continues to warm the bench. He needs to come on in a game we're winning to provide an extra problem for the opponent's defence to think about.
&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/whing.jpg'/&gt;
		All we want is a team of Andy Whings. Especially when he can scored headers like the one today.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The three points were surrendered quite early as Hyde scored from another cross which we failed to defend. This gave Oxford 20 mintues plus to get the right result, but the close was disappointing. A rare indirect free kick in the box was won when the Barnet goalkeeper had to make a top corner save from a back pass. The resulting shot was easily blocked by a large wall of amber and black. Only right at the end did we ask a suitable question of Barnet as Johnny Mullins' header hit the right post, bounced along the goal line, hit the left post, then bounced out. If it had gone in it would not have been a fair reflection of the game. A draw was about right, which is sad given that one team was challenging near the playoffs last season, while Barnet continue to be rock bottom of England's 92 clubs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
In what turned out to be his last match for the club, Johnny Mullins was on of only two players truely in the game. He came so close to getting the winning goal with his last touch in a yellow shirt. He will be sorely missed.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Barnet try to play a good brand of football under their suspended player coach Edgar Davids. They are rooted to the bottom of League Two and we failed to show why they deserve to be here.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='ground-photo-right'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tour: Underhill&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
I nearly didn't go to Underhill tonight based on recent performances, results, and the fact it was a Tuesday night. I'm glad I made the effort though as this was my last chance to go to this ground before the Bees move into a new Community Stadium next season. It's a 'proper ground', one where the stands have been built in sections with no thought whatsoever to the overall design. A ground where you can watch the game from your back bedroom if you house is in the right place. A ground where they don't take the mick when charging you for a hot chocolate or burger. It's friendly too.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://360.io/bQaxce' target='blank'&gt;See the panorama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Wimbledon and Bristol Rovers were smashed by Southend and Port Vale respectively, both by four goals. Wymcombe's win at a depleted Rotheram helped force the hand of Steve Evans in recalling Mullins. Northampton's win sees them one point below the playoff coming into Saturday match at the Kassam.

<title>Walking in Snowdonia</title>
<description>Staff away weekend at the Emily Kelly Hut, November 2012</description>

&lt;p&gt;
The penultimate weekend in November was the last opportunity to have a walking holiday this year. I went as part of the Lord Williams's School staff outdoors trip. We stayed at the &lt;a href='http://pinnacleclub.co.uk/club-hut/' target='blank'&gt;Emily Kelly Hut&lt;/a&gt;, right in the middle of Snowdonia, south of Capel Curig. The hut sits at the bottom of a deep valley (Nant Gwynant) next to a hydroelectric power station, at the end of a stony track. It is a perfect place for exploring Snowdon and the Glyders. The traffic from Thame to Wales was not to bad and we dined at the &lt;a href='http://www.berwynarms.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Berwyn Arms&lt;/a&gt;, in Glyndyfrdwy, a village the name of which I'm grateful to be typing not pronouncing.

&lt;div id='blog-photo-2'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/127/glyders.jpg' rel='lightbox[61]' title='A walk up the Glyders. Though the style on the right seems a bit pointless.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/127/glyders-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/127/style.jpg' rel='lightbox[61]' title='A walk up the Glyders. Though the style on the right seems a bit pointless.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/127/style-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;A walk up the Glyders. Though the style on the right seems a bit pointless.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On Saturday morning we set off by foot from the hut, walking up the valley north to the cafe at &lt;a href='http://www.caban-cyf.org/EN/goodServicesPYP.asp?id=59' target='blank'&gt;Pen-y-Pass&lt;/a&gt;, where we stopped for a coffee. It was a very warm morning for November in the sunshine. We then crossed the road and proceeded to climb up Glyder Fawr, then Glyder Fach, then turning south once near Tryfan to the junction of the A4086 and A498. Here we were expecting the Pen Y Gwryd hotel to be open for a pint, but it had scaffolding and was shut. It was not clear when or if it would reopen. So we had to continue to walk back to the hut, down a track. In the evening we drove to the &lt;a href='http://tyn-y-coed.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Tyn-Y-Coed&lt;/a&gt; pub in Capel Curig, a place I have been before. They have a nice range of sausages with mash and it was very busy, but we only had to wait half an hour for food. The selection of ales was excellent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next morning we got up with confidence and an ambition to climb Tryfan, but were held back by the large numbers of sausages and bacon that needed cooking, then eating. So with limited daylight we drove north to start a walk up Tal-y-Fan near Conwy, a trip of about 150 minutes.

<title>CS50x Week 3: Searching and sorting algorithms</title>
<description>How to program algorithms to sort data in an array and search arrays</description>
<link>http://www.tinorace.co.uk/blog.php?no=126</link>

<content>
&lt;p&gt;
This week's theme was how to search data for information, and how to do it as quickly as possible. If you were to search a phone book for a person, you would not start at A, then look through each name in turn until you came upon the person you wanted, especially if they were called Zlatan Zamalovic. This would be a 'linear search' and can be sometimes useful but not when an array is  thousands or millions of data long. In its place you would use a binary search, picking a point in the middle, and seeing which side of the middle the required term was in. By discarding the unnecessary half, the problem is halved each step. The number of steps to solve the problem follows log (n) where n = the size of the problem. This only works where the data is already sorted, like a phone book
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So we now need to know how to sort arrays. One option would be a Bubble sort where you pass along the array, comparing two values and if necessary swapping them. When you reach the end of the array you make another pass of the data, again swapping pairs where needed. The largest values bubble up to the top of the array. When you make a pass and make no swaps you know the problem is solved and you can stop. In a worst case scenario this could involved n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; steps. Another type called selection sort would involve passing along the array, keeping note of the lowest value, then swapping this to the start of the array, then passing again until you have done n passes. This will also take n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; steps to complete. By far the best option for large data sets (greater than 50) is merge sort, which breaks down an array of size n to n arrays of size 1. By comparing pairs of these smaller arrays, they can quickly be sorted into arrays of size 2. Then pairs of these arrays are rearranged to make larger arrays until the prolem is complete. This has the advantage of taking only n * log (n) steps to solve. One of the key messages was that there is always a trade off, whether it is increasing memory usage to reduce processing time, or increasing loading time to reduce later processing time. There is even the consideration to make of whether it is worth spending an extra hour or so improving the code if it only saves a second each time the program is run.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As part of PSET3 I started by making a binary search algorithm for presorted data, then sorting programs of the Bubble, Selection, and Insertion variety. The merge sort is more tricky and requires a lot more code to achieve. I then had to edit a program which makes the game 'Scrmable', adding functions to check if an entered word can be made using a random grid of letters and is in the dictionary. The grid function prints the grid of letters and is easy, the scramble function is easy, you just have to do some simple maths using a temporary array to rotate the grid. The harder function is the one which lookups up the entered word in the dictionary file and requires considerably more lines of code.

<description>Beers and wines for Christmas</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I've been without any home brew beers so I worked extra hard on a Sunday without much else to do to rectify this. In kegs I have a Stout and a lighter ale called Sundown (new from Woodforde's). Not very festive, but it was new so I was curious to try it. I have also bottled two ales: one is Christmas Ale  called Donner and Blitzed from Milestone, the other a copper brew from a cheaper range of kits. All of these should be ready by the time I put up the Christmas tree in two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In vinting news I bottled four wines as well. Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon from the California Connoisseur range, and an Apple and Gooseberry kit from the Young's fruit wine selection. Only an hour after it was bottled we drank one of the Gooseberry bottles and it was excellent; deliciously crisp and fresh.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A new tool in the armoury is alcotec's topup spirit range. For £2.99 you get a screw top bottle, which contains a small amount of liquid which just needs topping up with plain spirit (i.e. vodka). Bailey's and Jagermeister have now been added to the drinks cupboard.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To say Oxford United played poorly would be unfair, but it is clear that the turn around we have been promised with a fully fit squad is not transpiring. It was definitely an improvement on Tuesday night, and some good chances were created (though not finished). I can't say I heard the boos that were supposed to have eminated from certain sections of the ground, but I suspect they were more out of frustration at the long term situation the club is in rather than being endemic of a poor performance on the day. I was left with mixed feelings when the referee gave one last blast on his whistle. Relief that we hadn't lost to a club who challenge at the right end of the table. Pleased by some of the individual performances, annoyed with those who we know can deliver but aren't turning up at the moment. Frustration. Deep, deep frustration at the lack of a forward drive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tom Craddock was nominated for the league two player of the month. It was a shame that he had to go off at half time (injury, what else at this club?). James Constable was voted Oxford Player of the Month. He has provided vital assists and his alround game has been top notch. Finishing? Just don't ask him to score a goal. He had a range of chances, mainly where he played the offside trap well from long balls, but fluffed his lines in front of the keeper. While on the subject of awards I heard Chris Wilder was nominated for October manager of the month as well. At the moment there are fans who wouldn't even give him Oxford manager of the the month.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/heslop.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Simon Heslop had one of his better games, despite being played out of position.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Simon Heslop was played out of position on the right as Alfie Potter continues to recover from a hamstring niggle. Wilder said in interview he didn't want to change the system as it had been working. Isn't the golden rule of management to choose the best system for the players you have, not the other way around? While often lambasted, Heslop put in a good showing. The same cannot be said for Peter Leven, currently looking out of his depth in League Two. We know he's better than this. Is it lack of fitness? Lack of ambition and direction? Meanwhile we have Forster-Caskey warming the bench. I can understand that he may well not stay so the side must be shaped in the long term, but if Leven's not performing you have to go wit the best set of 11 on any one day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The final say was had by Martin Rice, Torquay's goalkeeper. Adam Chapman hit the ball low and well. How Rice got down quick enough to not only stop a certain goal, but hold on to it is a mystery. But it was a quality save that earned Torquay a point which no one can grumble with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Wright, Whing, Mullins, Heslop (Chapman 81), Rigg, Cox, Leven, Davis, Constable, Craddock (Pittman 46).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Cox. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Torquay Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Rice, Oastler, Nicholson, Downes, Saah, Lathrope (Yeoman 74), Mansell, Bodin, Easton, Craig, Jarvis (Thompson 68).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/mullins.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
I think all Oxford fans were delighted to see Johnny Mullins return to the starting lineup. He was very solid at the back and we never really looked like conceded. Corners and crosses were defended properly and it is essentially we can extend his loan deal when it expires soon.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/torquay.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Initially Torquay came to play football, but they looked a shadow of their former selves from last season when they challenged for the playoffs. As the game wore on and Oxford had the better chances, they became more content to sit back and see out the game with a point. Some timewasting was done, but the extra five minutes at the end only prolonged the misery of the event for both sets of fans.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/competitions/npower-league-two.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Dagenham's 5-0 win over Steve Evan's Rotherham was the biggest shock of the day. They have now moved up to mid-table. Gillingham look unbeatable, rescuing a point at Plymouth. Wimbledon and Bristol Rovers will be pleased wit their wins which leave Barnet and Aldershot in even more danger of dropping out of the Football League.

<description>Arrays, loops, and dealing with strings in C</description>

&lt;p&gt;
In week 2 of CS50x I was set a challenge to make an algorithm which encrypted data. This used the principle of ASCII math, where each ASCII character is represented by a number and this number can be changed using a key. In the Caeser key, all letters are changed by a fixed amount, e.g. if the key if 'g', then all characters are shifted up by 7, with letter higher than Z looping back to A. The Vigenere key requires the user to enter a key word, then each letter in the text is shifted depending where in the key you are, e.g. is the key is 'dog', then the first letter is shifted by 4, the 2nd by 15, the third by 7, then the fourth is shifted by 4 again as we return to the first character in the key. The concept of loops and arrays was introduced too, as C is incapable of recognising strings, so a string in C is really an array of characters over which you must iterate to do somthing with that string.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Recent good form since the poor showing on Sky TV turned out to be a false dawn as Oxford lost to a poor Dagenham and Redbridge. At no point were Oxford in the lead tonight, and even the reduction of the opponents to 10 men for the remaining 20 minutes did not help. Goals conceded were from the traditional corners. Michael Raynes took a slating on the phone ins due to his inability to win headers or make appropriate chllenges. Questions were asked about Wilder's team selection and why Mullins was left out. Disappointingly he used his interview to have a bit of a dig at his own fans. Dangerous water to tread given the number of fans who are calling for his exit. Craddock scored two in five minutes, but the comeback was thrown away by a goal conceded in between the two. No one really showed up today. Are the players not playing for the manager? Or is this the best he can get out of them. AS far as I'm concerned, time and my patience is running out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/craddock.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Tom Craddock's two goal haul was a rare highlight of a poor, poor game.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Capaldi (Davis 67), Raynes, Wright, Whing (Heslop 80), Rigg, Cox (Pittman 53), Leven, Craddock [2], Constable.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Chapman. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dagenham and Redbridge Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Lewington, Wilkinson, Ilesanmi, Doe, Elito, Saunders, Maher, Howell, Ogogo, Williams (Woodall 90), Gayle.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Maher. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; Maher. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/dagenham-redbridge.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Dagenham actually moved above Oxford tonight with this win, an elevated position for a team that has recently struggled. The three goals flattered the visitors, and reflected very poorly on the home team.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/competitions/npower-league-two.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Barnet drew level with Wycombe but remained in the drop zone after a 1-0 home win over Torquay. There were several 0-0 draws. Southend and Exeter were the only other teams able to register a win tonight. Hardly a classic night of football then.

Our final stop on our tour of South London was to the free museum at Greenwich. They are the National Maritime Museum, Queen's House, and the Royal Observatory and form part of the &lt;a href='http://www.rmg.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Royal Museums, Greenwich&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth member of this group is the Cutty Sark which you can see clearly but there is a charge to tour it. I drove into Greenwich but there is very limited free parking and it seemed very expensive for four hours, so we headed away from the river and parked for free in Deptford, a 5 minute walk from the Deptfor DLR stop. It was two stations along to Cutty Sark station. Greenwich has lots of nice restaurants, markets and shops, and we ate at Café Rouge using the &lt;a href='http://www.tastecard.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Taste Card&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/br&gt;One of the displays at the Maritime Museum is of ship's figureheads.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The closest free museum from the town centre is the National Maritime Museum, covering different types of boats, the roles of sea-going vessels in the colonisation of the Americas and opening of trade routes, and paintings and a cartoons of major naval event through history. Further on is Queen's House which is a portrait gallery on several levels and a convoluted route through to access all the different levels. From here you can go up the hill (5-10 minutes and its quite steep) to get to the Royal Observatory. There is a free visitors' centre which interactive videos, games, and photographs. In the gift shop I found an awesome Nuclear Physics tie which I now own. You can pay to see the Greenwich Meridian of GMT fame, and a selection of telescopes.

Crystal Palace park is an excellent park in South London. The park is home to a National Sports Centre, and the site of the former Crystal Palace exhibition hall which was destroyed by fire in 1936. As you enter from the south side of the park the first thing you encounter is the dinosaur lake. There are a range of model dinosaurs near the water and on the island in he lake. Around the circumference are information boards and and an audio trail offering more information about the dinosaurs at each station. There is a farm which is free to enter but has limited opening times so check the website for this. The maze claims to be one of the largest in the country and is challenging. When we went it had been raining and the puddles sometimes filled the full width of the path. The park is one of the highlights of South London.

Before the football, we took the Overground line from Crystal Palace, changing onto the Jubilee line at Canada Water to go to London Bridge. The &lt;a href='http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/' target='blank'&gt;Shakespeare Globe&lt;/a&gt; is a short walk from here along Bankside. There is a museum dedicated to Shakespeare's impact on the English language and the role of theatres in the development of the South Bank of the Thames. Sadly there is no cloakroom and the inside of the museum is very warm. The cost of the tour seems very expensive and overpriced at £13.50, but we used Tesco Clubcard vouchers to get in. The tour takes you inside the theatre and has funny anecdotes about plays and describes what it was like in Elizabethan times.

&lt;a href='img/blog/119/the-globe.jpg' rel='lightbox' title='The Globe is a replica of the original one.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/119/the-globe-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;The Globe is a replica of the original one.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the football we had £7.50 tickets to see an Andy Parsons gig at the Pleasance Theatre, just off the Holloway Road in North London. We had a pint or two in the Cross Keys (Wetherspoons and very cheap for London), then a Curry on the Taste Card. The gig only had about 40 people in and we were sat front row, though to the side so didn't get picked on. The gig was a pre-tour gig where comedians try out new material to gauge audience reaction. I thought Parsons was very funny and have always been a fan though watching Mock The Week.

This week had the first PSET which needed a program to be made using &lt;a href='http://scratch.mit.edu/' target='blank'&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt; and it should have a minimum level of complexity. My program easily exceeded this as I've had experience using Scratch before, well actually teaching it to Year 7. I decided to make a copy of Space Invaders called &lt;a href='http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/tinorace/2845579' target='blank'&gt;Robots From Space&lt;/a&gt;. I was happy with it and it plays well, though there is a slight bug in it at the end of a game which I don't have time to fix.

At the start of 2012 I enjoyed MITx's &lt;a href='blog.php?tag=6.002x'&gt;6.002x&lt;/a&gt; online course on circuits and electronics. This autumn (or fall if you are Atlantically-challenged) there are seven courses available online, offered by MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley. The three big players in the American university scene have combined forces under the name '&lt;a href='http://www.edx.org' target='blank'&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt;'. 6.002x is available again, and new courses are Solid State Chemistry, Software as Service, Artificial Intelligence, Quantitative Methods in Health Research, and MIT's Computer Science and Programming.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have chosen to do Harvard's &lt;a href='https://www.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x/2012/about' target='blank'&gt;Introduction to Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; as it looks a little more advanced than MIT's from the description, and covers a wider range of programming languages. The course starts on the 15th October and can be completed any time before 15th April. There are 9 programming assignments of 15-20 hours each, 2 quizzes, and a final project, all of which will build up to an honor code certificate.

&lt;div id='player-photo-right-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/etuhu.jpg'/&gt;
		Dickson Etuhu's header crashed against the crossbar.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was excited by the fact that the game I'd chosen to go to would be Henning Berg's first in his new job as manager. I have no doubt that he will turn things around, but this game came to early for him to have any impact. It was difficult with it being away and against a team in top form. From the evidence of today Berg has a huge job to turn things around such that Rovers gain promotion this season. The ultimate judgement on him will really be on &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; quickly he turns it around.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rovers deserved to take the lead when Etuhu headed against the bar from a Pedersen corner. Palace then had their chances but had to wait until stoppage time before they took the lead, Glenn Murray heading off the underside of the bar. Fine margins the difference between which team went in ahead. In the second half Wilfred Zaha tore Rovers to shreads. Murray won a penalty which he promptly score, but he was denied his hatrick after Robinson saved a second penalty. There was little sign of a comeback from 0-2 down. Kazim-Richards looked poor, but Formica and Rochina improved the tempo and drive through midfield. Rochina almost scroed a cracking goal, but againt his post hit the woodwork.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Crystal Palace Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Speroni, Ward, Delany, Ramage, Parr, Bolasie, Dikgacoi, Garvan, Jedinak, Zaha (Moxey 90), Murray.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Blackburn Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Robinson, Martin Olsson, Dann, G Hanley, Henley, Pedersen (Formica 59), Murphy, Marcus Olsson (Vukcevic 72), Etuhu, Rhodes, Kazim-Richards (Rochina 53).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/crystal-palace.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Crystal Palace were last minute survivors last season, but have completely turned it around. They too were without a manager after Dougie Freedman left to join Bolton. Today's win moved them up to third, but they look capable of challenging automatically. In Murray they have a striker who can score goals without looking special, and Wilfred Zaha they have an obvious future England star. If they can keep Zaha in January then they will go up, but Premiership teams will want him.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='ground-photo-right'&gt;
		&lt;a href='img/blog/116/crystal-palace-blackburn-rovers.jpg' rel='lightbox' title='Selhurst Park.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/116/crystal-palace-blackburn-rovers-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tour: Selhurst Park, London&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
This ground has got a hell of a lot bigger since I last went in the mid-90 to watch Rovers play Wimbledon in a midweek night game. The atmosphere created by the Palace fans was incredible. The ground is a 10 minute walk from the nearest tube stations, and all of the pubs nearby are designated as home only, a poor situation really. The stand I was in has posts so I sat quite low to avoid this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
New managers Freedman (Bolton), Dyche (Burnley), McCarthy (Ipswich) all won, leaving Berg as the only new manager to lose today. Hull, Huddersfield, and Middlebrough's wins make Rovers' job harder.

<title>The 39 Steps</title>
<description>Pub, dinner, and the theatre: a proper grown up's evening</description>

&lt;p&gt;
The 39 Steps is a long-running, famous play in London's West End. Originally the plan had been to go to Rock of Ages or We Will Rock You, but some very cheap tickets at £12 each were available, so we went to this adaptation of an Alfred Hitchcock film, itself based on an earlier book. We had no idea what it would be about. The basic premise is that a normal man living in London gets himself caught up in a spy plot about the mysterious '39 Steps' and is chased to Scotland under suspicion of murder. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The unique thing about this play is that there are only four cast members: the lead male, a female who plays all of the women, and two other people who play all of the remaining characters. This can either be as quick change back stage, or even costume change in the middle of sentences! The play doesn't take itself seriously at all, in fact it makes light of itself throughout and the script is peppered with puns relating to Hitchcock's other films. The play is hilarious and well acted. The £12 seat were restricted view, so there was a post in view and you are a fair way back but for the price I didn't feel this detracted enough to warrant paying a higher value.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Before the theatre we dined at &lt;a href='http://www.francospizzeria.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Franco's&lt;/a&gt;, a nice Italian restaurant using the Taste Card (even on a Friday night), and had a drink in the Montagu Pyke (Wetherspoons) and then at &lt;a href='http://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/pubs/london/tom-cribb' target='blank'&gt;The Tom Cribb&lt;/a&gt; (a Shepherd Neame) pub.

On the way from Reading to London, we drove via Bracknell and Ascot. Bracknell is unusual in that it is a town entirely surrounded by forest on its southern side, with no gradual change between the two. We went to the visitor centre and bought an Orienteering map for £1. There are three suggested courses, but more control points than you could hope to do in a sensible amount of time. My plan was to do the longest course, but if there was a control point on the way that was not part of the route, go visit it anyway. As we got half way around I decided that the long route might be a bit boring so we just picked random points to visit to take in as much of the forest as possible. It's a cracking forest, loads to see, and well catered for walkers, cyclists, and horses alike.

Due to a price increase for Thursday night at the hotel in London we'd planned to stay at, we looked elsewhere and found a room at a DeVere hotel for only £29. If you can get one at this price it is exceptional value for money. Included in the price was internet, free coffee and tea, a gym, a swimming pool, Nintendo DS and Wii, Tennis, and a very nice and spacious room. The hotel is near the village of Mortimer, south of Reading, but is set well back in a goal course and fields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the way to checking in we went via Reading where I bought a new coat and found free lunch and dessert thanks to O2 Priority Moments. I then found a home brew shop in south Reading off the Basingstoke Road. I stocked up on a Christmas beer amongst other things. After a game of tennis and a swim, we drove to &lt;a href='http://www.chefandbrewer.com/pub/old-bell-grazeley-green-reading/p1227/' target='blank'&gt;The Old Bell's&lt;/a&gt;, a Cehf and Brewer pub at Grazely Green. Their special menu was themed around 'game' and I can officially review the venison as being 'well nice'.

&lt;p&gt;
Oxford fans drove back up the M40 the happier set of supporters after a convincing 3-1 win away at relegation threatened Wymcombe Wanderers. The lead was taken by Constable after only 4 minutes when he low shot beat the keeper from distance. The weather was changeable and the second half started with a severe downpour. Oxford continued one of their own, a long ball to Craddock bouncing nicely for him, and his half-volley from 25 yards dipped perfectly past Bull. Only minutes later were Wymcombe fancying a comeback when Grant scored a penalty after a foul by Constable on Ainsworth. The remainder of the game though was made comfortable, a Mullins header from a Rigg cross leaving the result settled half an hour before the full time whistle.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/constable.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;James Constable got a much needed goal to support his good general play after only 4 minutes.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wycombe Wanderers Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Bull, Winfield, Dunne, Stewart, Doherty, Ainsworth (Morias 63), Lewis, Wood (Spring 78), Grant [1], Scowen, Kuffour (Logan 38).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Lewis, Kuffour. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Tom Craddock set up the opener and scored a stunner to really settle this game.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Wymcombe has had a terrible season in League Two after relegation at the first attempt from League One. Temporary manager Gareth Ainsworth has been inspirational on the pitch in the past few years, but he is struggling to replicate this as boss. It will be a long and tough season.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tour: Adams Park&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
The visitor's stand was very busy, but the rest of the ground was not as full as it could be, a sympton of Wycombe's poor start. The toilets were painted yellow and blue which was nice for us, but it was worrying when the rain was lashing down and I remembered the Dreams Stand was the one which was hit by lightning in the abandonded match with Bristol Rovers!

Most games today went with form, with only Bradford and Chesterfield left disappointed by losses to Burton and Barnet. Northampton beating Port Vale also opened a few eyes and opened up the gap from Gillingham to 5 points.

<title>Mathematics in Science</title>
<description>A day of CPD at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory to investigate ways of teaching Maths in Science lessons</description>

&lt;p&gt;
I spent a Wednesday on a teacher training course at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (only the visitors' room, we did not get the see the actual lab unfortunately). We started by discussing what sorts of things students struggle with. We identified units as being a problem, such as the confusion in Chemistry with are confusing e.g. dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and litres, how ml and cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are unintuitively the same. With A-level it is good to show that units balance in equations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
AS expected graphs were discussed. Showing a well thought out graph can promote good discussion and are very good for Y12 classes. So we dissected two graphs. For a simple journey to school, writing a description of a distance-time graph is much better for checking understand than just doing a calculation. Gradients are not always obvious so using numbers on the scale is important for interpreting speed. If the graph is a displacement-time graph it adds a higher level of understanding. The important thing is that you look for a story that is consistent with the facts. We then looked at a graph where two objects crossed. When describing the graph we realised that uniform, constant, steady all mean the same so why have 3 words? Care must be taken when taking about acceleration: the units of m/s/s or m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be confusing and it is important to avoid talking about 'fast' acceleration. For this type of graph 'Where are they travelling at the same same speed' is a clever question to catch out people. It is of course the place of same gradient not where the lines cross. Now we have to take the tangent to discover the instantaneous speed. Another concept to introduce. Our final discussion point was two F1 cars chasing each other. We were asked 'Where is the bend?': It's where the speed of the cars is lowest but you would also expect the answer to have a a range from entry to exit. Don't use the words 'starts at 0', often it's the recording that starts then. Looking at the change in the distance travelled can give a clue as to the acceleration. In this graph the average speeds seemed to decrease with a constant deceleration. The F1 question would make a good Gifted and Talented challenge. Remember that F1 distances are actually given in times. In GCSE Maths students are taught vector transformations of graphs and that's what this is. One of the biggest challenges of graphs is the scale, so I think lots of practice on this is needed at KS3.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In session 2 we looked at 'Improving learning in mathematics', a series of folders of resources. The aim of it is to improve practical teaching in maths and uses things like card sorts. Below are some of my random notes from the session:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What is area? Not using formulae, it's about covering a surface (amount of surface). Comes up in pressure and surface area to volume ratio
Calculate the area taken up by 1 million pound coins. At 22.5mm diameter the area is 22.5x22.5 m or 506m2. It's worth spending time seeing what a million looks like (e.g. Printing off an A1 sheet with a million dots on.&lt;br/&gt;
Data - Can show some data and manipulate the outcome in two different ways for two different groups. Will promote independent thinking.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Prime numbers - Laying out coins as you count them shows factors, squares. Prime numbers don't rectangulate.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fractions - Issues when dividing by numbers less than 1, confusion occurs when you end up with a larger answer.&lt;br/&gt;
Misconception is that dividing by half is the same as sharing between two people.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Percentages - Have a volume of water in a beaker to represent input energy. Then share out between two beakers to represent heat energy and light energy for a light bulb. Use for teaching Sankey diagrams use coloured water to help show it up.&lt;br/&gt;
In chemistry using a diagram of a molecule can help visualise percentage compositions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Pythagoras - Can check football pitches are squared by using a chain 12 long that forms a 3,4,5 triangle.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Common misconceptions &lt;br/&gt;
Lifting a rope 1.6m off ground always increases circumference by 10m&lt;br/&gt;
10km at 10kmph then 10km at 20kmph is not 15kmph. Don't take averages of averages!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Charles' Law School Science Review June 2010 measure a balloon expansion better than standard apparatus just put balloon in the freezer can get absolute zero.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Get PhET downloaded onto school network&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Next Step&lt;/h4&gt;
As I teach each topic at KS3 this year, I will look at how much Maths I can shoehorn into lessons. I will be doing this with Y7 and Y8. I will then evaluate the success of the various approaches and look to add them to the Schemes of work next year.

Oxford United were drawn away to Edgar David's Barnet who currently prop up League Two. In some ways it is a good draw as it is a match we should be aiming to win and gives us a good chance of reaching round 2 and beyond. But I'm fairly disapointed with it. In Round 1 you hope for either a home game against a higher division club or an away tie to some obscure non-league team providing a unique day out. Away to Barnet is just a standard League Two fixture and quite a dull one at that. Financially it's a poor draw too due to Barnet's low attendances. Hrumpth. The tie will be played on the 3rd of November which leaves me with a decision to make. Barnet vs Oxford United or Crystal Palace vs Blackburn Rovers. Both in the capital, likely both to be kicking off at 3pm. Hmmm....

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bouyed by the return of some key players, Oxford United thumped Accrington Stanley, with the bulk of the goals coming from an on-form Tom Craddock. The Yellows started brightly, dominating possession and chances. The first goal came when the ball fell to Craddock after a series of attempts, his shot not being held by the keeper Dunbavin and finding the back of the net. His second came eleven minutes later when he was the quickest on a ball in the penalty area. Stanley players got back to defend, so Craddock took the ball out wide for the cross, but seeing no challenge he took it back towards goal and finished low into the bottom left-hand corner. The early two goal cushion was not something Accy could ever come back from which really help an Oxford team low in confidence play their natural game and relax into the occasion. Craddock completed his first half hatrick, again thanks to good Oxford pressure and poor Stanley defending. He was on hand to blast the ball high into the middle of the net. The first half was a superb 45 minutes for the U's. The midfield pairing of Cox and Forster-Caskey were really up for it, winning tackles and keeping the ball moving. Potter and Rigg provided excellent width, and the 4-4-2 formation suited the players on the park today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After a great first half, the second half started in a disappointing fashion, with an understandably lower tempo, Stanley having time on the ball and winning loose balls more frequently. Eventually Oxford got going again, finding their best option being Sean Rigg. With the game won it was the perfect opportunity to bring on Peter Leven who replaced Forster-Caskey. His sublime touch and extraordinary vision created some good chances. A fit Leven will be key to turning the season around. More corners and chances followed, and the fourth for Oxford and Craddock came after good work from Constable. He out ran the defender to carry the ball into the box, then selflessly puled it back for Craddock place it simply into the goal. Oxford's final goal was created by Peter Leven's magical cross, Alfie Potter taking advantage of the left back's missed clearance hitting it under the keeper. It could have been more but Dunbavin was actually one of the best players on the pitch, saving from an Andy Whing header directed at the top corner.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/whing.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Andy Whing returned to the team after long-term injury and was superb.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Capaldi (O'Brien 55), Raynes, Mullins, Whing (Chapman 81), Rigg, Cox, Forster-Caskey (Leven 69), Potter [1], Craddock [4], Constable.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Accrington Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Dunbavin, Winnard, Molyneux (Liddle 67), Atkinson, Joyce, Schofield (Murphy 55), Mingoia, Lindfield (Dixon 55), Sampson, Amond, Boco.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Molyneux. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/craddock.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Finishing has been a problem of late, so it was great to see Tom Craddock get four goals. He took his chances very well and didn't put a foot wrong all match.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/accrington.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Accrington's keeper was excellent. Their midfield was ok in parts of the second half. But defensively Stanley were found out today. This was surprising as Stanley are normally a difficult team to play against. Their travelling support of 96 was excellent, outsinging Oxford in the latter stages even while 5-0 down and even ironically singing 'We can see you sneaking out' as some U's fans left early with the job done. Stanley fans deserved their round of applause from the home end.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/109/oxford-united-accrington-stanley.jpg' rel='lightbox' title='Accrington's fans literally could have come in a taxi.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/109/oxford-united-accrington-stanley-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Accrington's fans literally could have come in a taxi.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Oxford finished the day in 18th position, but only 3 points off the play-offs. Its a weird old league. Gilllingham and Port Vale moved away from Fleetwood at the top as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Wimbledon. Rotherham and Braford continued to win. Bristol Rovers had an important win over Torquay, while all the over teams in the middle continue to beat each other.&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I put on my Blackburn Rovers scarf and went down to Court Place Farm, where the blue and white colours worked well at Oxford City's home game against Workington. I was expecting good things as City have made a good start to their debut in their highest ever position in the football pyramid. Entrance was £11, though there were additional entrance offers being run in celebration of Non-League Day, a day aimed at getting Premiership and Championship fans along to their non-league alternatives over the international weekend. I was able to go as Oxford United's match was moved to Monday to be shown on Sky Sports.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/108/oxford-city-workington-1.jpg' rel='lightbox[108]' title='Court Place Farm, Oxford.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/108/oxford-city-workington-1-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Court Place Farm, Oxford.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Workington, a former league club but before my time, were the prettier passing team and played the better football. They were unable to really create any chances while City were clinical and efficient going forward. Workington started brightly with an early corner, but City had the better chances. Declan Benjamin on the overlap down the right wing and put in a fantastic cross for ex-Oxford United striker Jamie Cook but he handled the ball. He then set up another, beating two players with pace and trickery, but Darren Pond was guilty of a band miss, blasting over on the volley when a header seemed the better option. Captain Andy Ballard was impressive in the first half and was at the centre of many of City's best opportunities. His long, arrow-like throw-in earned a corner, which he then headed on target but was cleared off the line.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Workington had a good break against the Oxford City pressure and looked like they would create something but Jacob Walcott tracked back superbly, winning the ball before putting Cook through on goal. The goalie made the angle narrow and Cook's shot was inches wide. Another Ballard throw won another corner taken by left-back Paul Stonehouse. He spotted the run of right-back Jack Mills who was tracked too lazily by Workington's Jake Simpson. Mills passed it into the six yard box where Ballard picked up the ball, turned, and hit straight into the roof of the net. A deserved 1-0 leadgoing into the break. It could have been more when Ballard's cross found summer-signing Nabil Shariff who could only head wide. The skipper was finished, again pipcking out Shariff who in turn knocked on to Banjamin who thundered a half-volled just over the bar.

&lt;/br&gt;Oxford City in action against Workington.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Two minutes into the second half the game was dead and buried as Shariff capitalised on a mistake by the keeper to tap in. Apparantly. I was in the queue for a sausage bap and didn't see it. Benjamin, who had caused problems on the right, went off injured. Workington had a good chance from a free kick hit over the wall but Warren Carter was positioned well to save. Then enter Steve Basham, anothe ex-OUFC striker, and a class apart. A good ball up to him gave him a shot at goal which was only parried. Jamie Cook was fastest, but he was patient, waited for the keeper to commit to the ground, before dinking it over him. Very classy goal. It was not long before 3-0 turned into 4-0 as Stonehouse crossed for Basham to flick it past the oncoming goalkeeper. Cook's fine game came to an end when replaced by Felipe Barcelos. The talented Brazilian forward came close, volleying just over from the edge of the penalty area. Basham then crowned a fine cameo performance to make it 5-0 when he was found unmarked, blasting it into the net.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An excellent win for the home team, the result embarrased a far from poor Workington. This was City's 7th win out of their first twelve games and while they will struggle to catch the likes of Brackley and Chester who may well walk this league, they are putting themselves in a great position to achieve a play-off spot. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Kayaking the Thames from Redbridge to Abingdon (River</title>
<description>An easy route made quiet by no river traffic</description>

&lt;p&gt;
The route I took today started near Redbridge park and ride, on Oxford's Southern bypass, starting on Weir's Mill Stream, joining Hinksey Stream, then the River Thames at the Kennington Railway Bridge. The only lock on route was the Sandford Lock, which we portaged via the weir branch. Our end point was Abingdon at the Abbey Meadows car park.
You can view the &lt;a href='http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/101342383' target='blank'&gt;MapMyRun route page&lt;/a&gt;, or see a 3D fly through below.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe width='100%' height='350px' scrolling='no' src='http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/render_route_video?route_key=860134961994148943&#38;site=mapmyrun.com'&gt;
            &lt;a href='http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/143707169'&gt;12.01 km Kayak in Kennington on 7 Oct 2012 15:25&lt;/a&gt; and more runs in Kennington, United Kingdom on MapMyRUN. &lt;a href='http://www.mapmyrun.com'&gt;Find run&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing to do was drop the kayak at the put in. We pulled over on Abingdon Road by the Redbridge Park and Ride to do this. I took the kayak to a field. The gate was locked but no one was around so it was easy to get to. Jo drove the car and left it at the Abbey Meadows car park in Abingdon which is free on a Sunday. She then got the bus (X13, X3, X2, or 35 will all do) to Redbridge and walked to meet me in the field. A man approached me as I was waited and he didn't want to encourage launching here as it was private fishing land. He explained that normally there are ponies in the field, boats moored, and fishermen fishing here, but it was quiet because thje river was so high. He was nice enough and was ok for me to launch on this occasion but on another time this is not a recommended place to put in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had kayaked up Weirs Mill Stream on my &lt;a href='blog.php?no=86'&gt;last kayaking trip&lt;/a&gt;, but this time we headed downstream away from Oxford. Upstream takes you to the Thames with access to Iffley, but heading south it is quicker to go downstream to meet with Hinksey Stream just after the Ring Road. This then connects to the River Thames south of Iffley Lock at a railway bridge. The water level was high and after returning home I found that the &lt;a href='http://riverconditions.environment-agency.gov.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Environment Agency&lt;/a&gt; website listed this part (and most parts) as CAUTION STRONG STREAM in a red background. The key said this: 'We advise users of all boats not to navigate because the strong flows make it difficult and dangerous.' The inflatable (and unsinkable) Colorado Sevylor is very stable and I had no problem being out on the river, perhaps a more traditional kayak might be at more risk. With these warnings in place there was no other rivers traffic which was great not having to get out of the way of powered boats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only lock was Sandford lock. The left fork going downstream takes you to the lock, the right to the weir, which was thunderous with the water level. We got out on the right bank of the right fork, well before the weir, and found a narrow but walked path. We portages as far as the weir, then turned to the right down the bank to the lower level of the river. Here it is quiet, calm and surrounded by trees, a very easy put in as long as the vegetation is not too overgrown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The rest of the journey was straight forward down to Abingdon Lock. The lock is connected by a footpath over the lock and weir to Abbey Meadows, a large park in Abingdon. While we've walked around here a lot in the past we decided to get out at the lock and walk it over the narrow weir bridge. We couldn't quite remember whether the stream running into the park was before or after the weir and didn't want to risk it in the strong stream. There was not too much pedestrian traffic to impede us but on a sunny day you will find a lot of people coming in the opposite direction. Once over the weir bridge we were able to put in at the stream. If the river is calm and you are a competent kayaker you can just paddle straight from the Thames into the stream as long as you keep well over to the right bank away from the weir. We finished journey on this calm backwater leading right upto the site of the former abbey and a short walk from the car park. There were only ducks here as it was October, but I would not do this earlier in the year as it is a swan nesting area, and there is not really anywhere to get away from them. If it is springtime, just walk!

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The result doesn't quite explain the performance or the match. Gillingham were by far the more dominant team, but a plucky Oxford pulled off their first clean sheet since Swindon against the league leaders to hold on for a deserved point. Gillingham had the lion's share of possession and created a decent number of chances, but a makeshift defence did well. When Batt went off injured the back four of Boateng, Mullins, Wright, and O'Brien had not played together before. Smalley also was injured in the first half. The rate of at least two injuries per match is becoming a joke and there is something desperately wrong to be causing this - it can't simply be 'luck'. It forced Wilder's hand as ideally Constable would have come on sooner, but with two subs already made it had to be left late. There is certainly a problem between Wilder and Constable as he was second choice off the bench to Craddock at half time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There were good performances from Heslop after starting the season poorly, and Rigg was causing problems again down the left. Oxford finished the game very strongly putting the Gills on the back foot, but only five shots, none of which were on target shows how light weight we are up front at the moment. Defensively this was a very solid and positive match but there is definitely a issue in chance creation and conversion as a result of the way we play.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/heslop.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Simon Heslop is finding his previous form and earning himself a place in the side.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Batt (Boateng 42), Wright, O'Brien, Mullins, Chapman, Heslop, Rigg, Forster-Caskey, Smalley (Craddock 46), Potter (Constable 82).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gillingham Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Nelson, Fish, Martin, Flanagan, Barrett, Wright (Montrose 55), Payne, Whelpdale, Weston (Findley 59), Kedwell, Burton (Frampton 70).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Findley, Kedwell. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
In any other game the obvious choice would have been new boy Johnny Mullins who offered fantastic protection and a dominate presence in the back four. But everyone's MOM today was Ryan Clarke who pulled off some Gordon Bank's like saves to keep Oxford in the game. The saves were genuinely world class.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/gillingham.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
I thought Oxford fans who suggested that they didn't know how Gillingham could be top of the league were not giving a fair analysis. Gillingham played as well as Exeter did, the only difference was that Oxford played well in this game unlike in the Exeter match. This was the Gills' first non-win away from home and only the 3rd match in which they've dropped points. It will be interesting to see next Monday's game against Port Vale to compare these two promotion chaising teams. I fully expect Gillingham will be still up there in May.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
At the bottom end, Bristol Rovers, Wycombe, Wimbledon, and Dag and Red had massive wins, leaving Barnet trailing on 3pts in 11 games. Aldershot are now in 23rd place losing at home to Chesterfield. Port Vale caught up on the Gills while newboys Fleetwood occupy the 3rd automatic promotion place. Oxford are 5 points off the play offs and 5 points off the relegation zone.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/robinson.jpg'/&gt;
		Paul Robinson was Rovers' busiest player as Forest created chance after chance.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My second Rovers away game in a row saw no improvement in the performance in performance and less attack and more defence. I might think I am a bad omen. A more sensible conclusion would be that Eric Black isn't going to get this team playing well and we are desperately in need of a manager to come in and put things right. Like in the Charlton match, Rovers started strongly, then sat deeper and deeper, inviting Forest forward. Forest had 17 chances to Rovers 5 which is a poor stat for a Blue fan. The most telling stat of the game was this though: each side only had 1 shot on target. And it was this that really let Rovers off the hook. Forest failed to convert the simplest of chances, while Rovers failed to create any.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The away end had a great atmosphere with fans in fine form. Perhaps it was the defensive 5-3-2 formation that prevented Rovers from playing well. Luckily the defense which usually lets in at least one goal a game kept a clean sheet, a rarity since the loss of Big Sam, and it was well timed. Black was too slow to make the changes in the second half and by the time he did it was just a case of hanging on for the point. We missed Etuhu in midfield who was out with flu. Hopefully Rovers can play better at the weekened against Wolves in front of a packed Ewood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-left-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/murphy.jpg'/&gt;
		Danny Murphy's performance once again drew criticism from the fans. I just cannot see what he brings to the team.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nottingham Forest Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Camp, Harding, Collins, Halford, Ayala, Gillett, Cohen, McGugan (Jenas 72), Reid (Coppinger 85), Lansbury (Majewski 63), Sharp.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Blackburn Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Robinson, Orr, Martin Olsson, Givet, Dann, G Hanley, Lowe, Formica, Murphy, Rhodes (Dunn 86), Nuno Gomes (Kazim-Richards 63).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/hanley.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Although Paul Robinson made some good saves, Grant Hanley was also kept very busy, but he generally dealt very well with ball crossed into the box and made solid defensive headers all night.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/notts-forest.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Forest weren't expecting this to be such an easy game for them, but struggled to take the myriad of chances presented to them and that they created. This shows how difficult it is when you only have one fit striker. Defensively they seemed solid, keeping Gomes, and Rhodes especially, very quiet all game. If they can start taking their chances they will move up to the right end of the table after a difficult season last year, with effectively a brand new team still waiting to gell properly.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='ground-photo-right'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tour: City Ground, Nottingham&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Nottingham from Oxfordshire is a long journey on a Wednesday night, but I made it anyway. Even though Forest wanted to move to a new ground if the World Cup came to Nottingham, the City Ground is still a great stadium, worthy of the Premiership. Forest fans were very quiet, only really getting going towards the end of the evening. The whole atmosphere outside the ground was very friendly and there is a lot of stall geared up for the football. What a pleasure it is to have a stadium within reasonable walking distance of a city centre in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Middlesbrough and Derby's 2-2 draw was the only other game tonight, as other clubs played in Tuesday. Cardiff's win over Birmigham keeps them top, a point ahead of Leicester and another from Brighton who slip to third. Blackpool came from behind to beat Hull. Crystal Palace's 2-1 defeat of Wolves sees them climb to 7th, a shock position after last season's misery.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a Tuesday night match between two of the leakiest defences in the league, the 3-2 win to Oxford says it all. The fact that both teams failed to hold onto a lead reflects the situation they are in. Both teams even had a goalkeeper called Brown who didn't play very well. The parallels were broken though by the quality of finishing in easy situation, on which Oxford were the better side. It was touch and go as to what tone with report would take, but I am delighted to say that a first league win since August has put a little positivity back into the club.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Wimbledon started with early pressure including a few corners, but with Oxford weathering that storm it was Sean Rigg who started to come on top with some great form on the left side of midfield in a 4-4-2. It was his run, cutting inside, which led to a free kick taken by Jake Forster-Caskey. The Brighton loanee curled it the wrong side of the wall into the top left corner leaving Wimbledon's Brown with little chance of making the save. Rigg created more chances, the best falling to Potter who failed to do anything useful with it. The Dons then managed to fashion some good chances which a better team would have taken. The U's could have conceded 3 or 4 by this point.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/forster-caskey.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Jake Forster-Caskey's free kick was Oxford's opener and his third of the season.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Wimbledon equalised when they capitalised on some poor Oxford defending, typically from a corner which has been a weak area recently. Wayne Brown failed to deal with the corner and after a mini game of head tennis Harrison bundled in. They then took the lead when Fenlon took a speculative snap shot from distance which found the bottom corner. At this point some fans were accused of 'celebrating' the Wimbledon goal. I think it was more a sarcastic response to the criticism they got earlier to turning a 'hate Swindon' song into a 'hate Wilder' song, which was a stupid thing to do. Ironically this had the action of actually getting the fans behind the team and the team performance lifted to its best of the game. I do think some fans fail to understand that criticism of a manager does not mean lack of loyalty. Blind faith is not a good quality. I think anyone who turned up tonight was more loyal than those who stayed at home to listen on the radio. I don't buy the 'you don't like Wilder so your not a real fan' argument. Either way, recent performances and results have contributed to falling attendances and fan disharmony.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At half time, Heslop replaced Cox, a very risky and brave move on the part of Wilder, but one which paid off. Despite recent poor form, Heslop played very well, getting on the ball in midfield and driving the team forwards. It was really good to see this switch work out well. After Raynes had gone off injured in the first half, Brown followed to be replaced by Clarke who I was surprised didn't start after Brown's pooer game at Rotherham. Another game, another two injuries. You make your own luck in football, something is wrong with this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Oxford drew it back to 2-2 when a Potter header was fumbled by the visiting keeper, and Deane Smalley was the quickest to react. Chances, corners, and possession continued to come, but OUFC had to wait until the 82nd minute for the winner, when Batt, then Craddock worked the ball into the centre, the latter crossing to Potter to tap home with ease. Wimbledon were not done and had several chances, unlucky to find the post and wasting easy chances right in front of goal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Positives: Great result, not just in terms of the game, but in the context of the season. Heslop's improved form.
On the other hand, Oxford gifted Wimbledon chances. Players were not closed down well enough. Another team would have destroyed us. The main thing is the players will draw confidence from the result, especially with a game against top of the league, in-form Gillingham on Saturday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Brown (Clarke 60), Batt, Raynes (Worley 33), Wright, O'Brien, Rigg, Forster-Caskey [1], Cox (Heslop 46), Smalley [1], Potter [1], Craddock.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Wright, Forster-Caskey. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wimbledon Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Brown, Fenlon [1], Francomb, Antwi, Mambo, S Moore, Jolley (Johnson 76), Gregory, Harrison [1] (Strutlon 77), Midson, L Moore (Yussuff 61).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Francomb, Antwi, Gregory. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Sean Rigg was already in my mind for man of the match at half time. He went a little quiet at time, second half included, but he made the difference. His crosses were top notch, he gave the right back a hard time, and he importantly created chances. It was great to see him back on the form he showed at the start of the year, and on the back of a great goal at Rotherham.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Most teams this season will look at Wimbledon's lack of points, and their huge negative goal difference and expect an easy win. Today they had no problem creating chances, and threatened in the air. Where they were lacking was in dealing with Oxford on the wings, and between the sticks I though they goalkeeper looked weak. He parried simple catching chances and gifted Smalley Oxford's equaliser. The Dons recently sacked Terry Brown who had guided them up from the non-league but was struggling at league level. What they mainly failed to do was see out a lead when they sat back. This might be their return to the 5th tier of the pyramid.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/competitions/npower-league-two.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Exeter, Gillingham, and Fleetwood all continued their excellent form with wins. Wymcombe's failure to beat Plymouth kept them in the bottom two. Dagenham and Redbridge will be delighted with a point as Potr Vale. Overall, little change in the table.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/etuhu.jpg'/&gt;
		Dickson Etuhu scored for Rovers, finishing well after Gomes and Rhodes combined with quick passing.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Steve Kean's resignation less than 24 hours before kick off was a shock due to its timing if not its reasoning. His former number 2 Eric Black took charge and Rovers fans were in party mood with many wearing party hats and bringing balloons. Rovers started well enough, opening the scoring through Dickson Etuhu who finished off a lovely and quick passing interchange.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
Rovers then sat too deep, inviting Charlton on. When a ball was crossed in, Pedersen fouled Cort in the penalty area. The shot was blasted straight down the middle and although Robinson dived to his left still managed to save it with his feet. Rovers defenders were slow to react and within a minute Charlton had equalised and the Blues didn't clear the ball. The shot was a little lucky as it took a deflection on the way in, but the outcome was deserved. This woke Charlton up and they continued to dominate the game, but never really threatened except for a couple of decent chances. Robinson made some good saves as the defence continued to allow shots to come in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/dunn.jpg'/&gt;
		David Dunn's performance lifted Rovers and gave some impetus going forward, but came on too late to have a real impact.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The travelling support demanded changes to increase the attacking play, with Dunn finally coming on for Nuno Gomes. Dunn was the spark needed to see Rovers finish on a high, but his introduction was too late. No other changes were made, while Murphy had a quiet match and should have been replaced by a more potent threat such as Nunes or Rochina. Rhodes had a late chance that was just wide after a decent game linking up well with others. On the balance of play Rovers will be happy with a point but really should have come for more than a draw. All in all a poor performance that never really got going.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Charlton Athletic Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Hame, Morrison, Solly, Cort, Jackson [1] (Pritchard 53), Green, Stephens, Hollands, Wilson, Wright-Phillips, Kerkar.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Blackburn Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Robinson, Orr, Martin Olsson, Givet (G Hanley 46), Dann, Lowe, Pedersen, Murphy, Etuhu, Rhodes, Nuno Gomes (Dunn 73).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Lowe, Murphy. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;

		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/robinson.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Paul Robinson made some important saves to save a point for Rovers. He saved the penalty but was let down by his defence who failed to defend properly in the aftermath.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/charlton.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Charlton will be disappointed not to take three points as they were the only team to really want the win, outshooting Rovers nearly 3 to 1. They remain only 2 points above the drop zone after a surpringly poor start to the season after promotion from League One.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tour: The Valley, London&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
As it has been developed since my last visit a long time ago, The Valley is now a large and impressive stadium. The Jimmy Seed away end is the last to renovated so is a bit basic but the view is great. The ground is a short walk from the railway station which gets very busy. The Anglican was an away fan pub, was the nearest one to the gound, and was packed with Rovers fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Burnley came from behind to draw with Millwall. Wolves have started climbing the table after a poor start. Cardiff's 3-0 win over Blackpool has put them in the driving seat. Bolton's miserable run continued with a home defeat to Crystal Palace.

<title>Kean's gone: a step in the right direction</title>
<description>Steve Kean unexpectedly resigns less than 24 hours before kick off</description>

&lt;p&gt;
The soap opera at Blackburn Rovers took another unexpected twist as Steve Kean resigned on the eve of their away match at Charlton. Rovers fans will deservedly be in party mood in the capital tomorrow and I am feeling very optimistic about the mood and direction of the club and very much looking forward to my second trip to The Valley.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/blog/102/steve-kean-resigns.jpg'/&gt;
		Kean resigns as Blackburn manager: possibly the greatest news headline ever.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rovers fans have taken a lot of stick in the national media, particularly from southern journos. Meanwhile the newspaper reporters and TV presenters in Lancashire have understood the situation and taken a more pragmatic view of the situation. Notable critics of Kean have included Lancashire Evening Telegraph reporter Andy Cryer, and North West Tonight and Radio Lancashire presenter Graham Liver. And then there's the former players. Robbie Savage on FiveLive, Michel Salgado, Kevin Gallacher, all players who fell in love with the club and felt strongly enough to want Kean to leave. If you are not a Rovers fan and you are still not convinced Kean should have gone... would you want him at your club?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your answer to the previous question is still yes, you are probably not fully aware of the facts. Here is a simple of Kean's achievements at Rovers.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoted from assistant to manager, due to dodgy agent Jerome Anderson having hands on role in club&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signed Myles Anderson, son of Jerome Anderson. Myles plays no games for the club before being sent off to League Two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kean is banned from driving for drink-driving offence, then blames Rovers fans for setting him up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sells Phil Jones, Chris Samba, and Ryan Nelson in space of 12 months. Rovers let in huge amounts of goals and get relegated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puts legend Michel Salgado into footballing limbo over the sake of a few quid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tells media its only 1% of Rovers supports protesting against him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes team to Tottenham needing win to realisitically stay up. Has no shots on goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relegates &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publicly slags off Sam Allardyce and is posted on YouTube. Allardyce starts legal proceedings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signs three players he has never seen play before. East Lancashire is declared a colony of Portugal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ends Rovers career with a 28% win record, the worst of any Rovers manager. Ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is sacked by Rovers with statements prepared for release on Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mrs Kean begs for Mr Kean's job. Kean's job is saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kean weasels his way out of Rovers job saying his position is unteneable. Well yes.. because of the 28% win record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On quitting jobs tells two more lies: 1) That majority of fans supported him, 2) Rovers are in the automatic promotion places, they were actually 3rd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what was the final nail in the coffin? Well according to Rovers managing director Derek Shaw, club chairwoman Mrs Desai was disappointed to see Kean go. Is this to save on any possible compensation or genuine delusion? Global Advisor Shebby Singh, a notable critic of Kean, refused to comment on Kean's long term future after last weekend's defeat to Middlesbrough. Though a statement was released saying that Kean would be in charge at Charlton. He also travelled down with the squad on the Friday night and presumably checked into the London hotel. 8pm on a Friday night is a bizarre time to quit, which makes me think something has happened since this lunchtime to force Kean's hand. If the owners wanted him gone then last weekend was the time to do it. Why would they wait? I can only think some kind of player revolt was the final blow. I mean, why else would you travel down to London if you knew you were going to quit? Unless being a Scot he wanted to make use of the free hotel room.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The only other thing I can think of if the commercial side of it which was always going to be a killer. And for this Rovers fans can take the credit. Attendances which were plus 20000 last season fell to 13000 for the first four home games. With Kean not appearing to be going a planned protest for the following weekend would have seen even the fans who had already bought tickets not using those tickets and staying away. Commerical suicide to keep Kean, and this would have become more apparant as the week went on and ticket sales didn't increase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So who next. Well first the unrealisitic targets: Capello, Redknapp, Ranieri, Benitez, Eriksson.&lt;br/&gt;
Now the club heroes with little or no league managerial experience: Tugay, Sherwood, Shearer, Flitcroft (doing alright at Chorley).&lt;br/&gt;
Now some more realistic prospects at a Championship club: Alan Curbishley, Mick McCarthy (not a fan).&lt;br/&gt;
I'd be surprised if we went for the poaching option. Who can say. All we know is it's exciting times ahead.

<title>So what's going wrong at OUFC?</title>
<description>An attempt to look at what Oxford United need to improve on to progress to League One</description>

&lt;p&gt;
I'm going to start this article by being up front and saying that I'm in the Wilder Out camp, but this article is not just an anti-Wilder rant. I was in favour of change at the top when we lost to Southend last season ruling out our slim chance of reaching the playoffs. Then I decided to shut up and get behind the players and manager. The fourth defeat in a row against Cheltenham which, I will admit I didn't watch, was the trigger for me to readvocate this. As I said earlier, this is not just a list of reasons for replacing our manager, but actually a compilation of various views expressed in recent weeks on Twitter, BBC Oxford, Jack FM, and of course my own opinions on last five matches weeks and the last few years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tactics, formations, and Plan B&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first criticism often made of Chris Wilder is tactics and the lack of a Plan B when things go wrong. Possibly a harsh criticism you might think as he gets its right more often than he gets it wrong. And when it does go right no one ever calls Wilder the master tactician who got it right. Or maybe you will look to a persistent, almost blind faith, in a 4-3-3 system which really is just a 4-5-1 with strikers playing as wingers. Potter plays well in this system, but Constable and Smalley are at their least effectual when they end up wide. On rare occasions a switch to 4-4-2 has been made and sometimes been the impetus to do better and sometimes made no difference. The tactics simply don't change from match to match. No matter who the opponent is, whether they are coming to park the bus, or to have a go at us, the formation and style of play stays the same.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Defending set pieces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over recent matches a significant number of goals have come from the team's inability to defend corners, other set pieces, and crosses from open play. Every time an opponent gets a corner there is an sense of inevitability. The number of goals conceded is misleading to how bad the problem is. I can remember many matches this season where only the lack of quality finishing down at League Two level has prevented unchallenged headers being converted into goals. I can't pinpoint exactly what is going wrong apart from the easy with which we are allowing free headers, but I know that in training I would be making this a priority area. Given how bad it is at the moment, perhaps it would be a good idea to get every player back to defend corners. New personnel are also needed in this department.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Attacking set pieces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From direct free kicks we can be an exciting threat when Chapman and Leven stand over the ball, but for free kick from out wide and corners we simply don't threaten the opposition enough. When the team are playing well the number of corners we get is phenomenal and, especially when in front of the East Stand, can really get the crowd going. So it seems like such a waste when they come to nothing. A common mistake is hitting the ball too long. Or is it an organisational failure to have someone attacking at the back post to capitalise on this? This is a recurring theme for corners. Another problem is that the ball just simply always falls to the opposition. This suggests that players are in the wrong position or are too slow to react when mistakes are made.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Investment, and squad depth&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Investment in the squad has been minimal. Ian Lenegan promised an end to the reliance on loan players. However our strongest team with a fully fit squad would only contain 1 new signing since last season. That addition would be Jake Forster-Caskey, a season long loanee from Brighton. Raynes looked good at first but has since been revealed to make too many crucial mistakes. Three other defenders to join are all loanees including Sean McGinty who was sent back after 1 minute of pitch time. In midfield Sean Rigg was not started today despite the midfield being decimated by injury and illness. Lee Cox is a long term loanee. Up front there have been no signings. Those in favour of no change will advocate the injury crisis this season (and last season, and the season before that...) and it has been a massive problem. Those in favour of change will argue that Wilder has had several years to develop this squad and make sure that there is sufficient cover. A caller on BBC Oxford argued that it is of course a squas game now and the squad isn't good enough even if the best 11 can be one of the best teams in the league.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Behind the scenes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The departure of Kelvin Thomas as chairman and replacement with Ian Lenegan, the owner who wants to take a more hands on role, was never going to see things stay the same. Lifelong OUFC fan and director Jim Rosenthal quit the board recently, with neither the outgoing Rosenthal, nor the club chosing to comment on the reasons. Obviously Rosenthal and Lenegan don't see eye to eye on something though no one knows what. I would never criticise Jim's commitment to or passion for the club, but as fans start to suspect major internal problems, I think he should demonstrate his love for the club by revealing exactly why he left the board. If there is something which might result in the club going through a dark age or god forbid see a return to the Conference, then it's no good saying a few years down the line what the problems were. They need to be revealed now so that slight damp patch on the club wall can be prevent from turning into a rot. If there isn't a major issue then he should also come out with that too, as it would be put a lot of fans at ease. Some fans think Wilder is the problem, and other think Lenegan is the one would should go. Apparently Lenegan has invested £4M recently which is good, but there is definitely something not right behind the scenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Falling attendances&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a sympton of the problems rather than a cause. Back when OUFC were promoted back to the league attendances were hitting over 7000 for most Saturday matches. Even when we had won three in a row this season we were still in the 6000s. Clearly the post-promotion buzz has started to wear off after a couple of years, and the next home games, home to Wimbledon on Tuesday night, possibly on the back of a 6th defeat, could see it fall to 5000 for what I think would be the first time since we were in the Conference. It is a combination of performances and results which are turning away some of the more fickle punters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conference-level players&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For continuity it was good not to have a massive clear out after promotion, but now it is time to say goodbye to the remainder of the players who have not moved on yet. Constable hasn't scored enough goals at League Two to justify his continual occupation of an offside position just when we need an outlet to pass to. Refs haven't taken to kindly to his passion either. Initially we thought it was bad reffing, but really he needs to stop complaining about pushing and just get on with the job of winning the ball in the air which he doesn't seem to do very well. Yes his is commited and gives his all, but this shouldn't cloud our judgment. After that you are really struggling to see where goals will come from in the strikers. Neither Smalley, Pittman, nor Craddock have looked like going on a proper scoring run in the last 12 months. Before that we can all name a long succession of forwards who were brought in and had no impact. Unfortunately two of the players deemed not good enough for League Two before they even had a chance were Jack Midson who amassed an impressive total for Wimbledon last year, and Dannie Bulman who is statistically one of the best players in League One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Heavy defeats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford have not had a big win in a very long time. Wins usually come on the back of a couple of goals. Even when playing really well, the goals just don't seem to flow. When the U's travel and concede a couple of goals, the heads seem to go down and the goals leak in. Last season we only score three or more in 3 matches. The same was done to us in 6 matches. This season we have conceded three or more in 4 matches already.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People will always have their opinions and it will be difficult to change people's minds; only results and performances can do that. If the person who is our manager does not change, then the manager has to make changes. If Wilder stays we can only improve if he develops flexibility. He needs new players, new tactics, and an ability to recognise weaknesses and improve on them. Back when we were winning and we had a minor blip, he would refuse to accept criticism from fans when giving interviews. A week ago when we had had our 3rd defeat on the trot he said he would not change his team based on the results. I doubt he can say or do either now and expect to keep his job. I'm not saying I have the solutions to the problems outlined above or I would be a football manager, but surely someone at OUFC should.
&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford went into today's match on the back of four straight league defeats, and in a lowly 16th in League Two. The task was made harder with an ever-growing crock list now featuring Jon-Paul Pittman and Adam Chapman. What really did it for Oxford today was the lack of commitment shown by the players and the lack of a plan B when things were going wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first half was a dire affair, with only one shot on target for each team. Bradford had a bit more possession in the final third but failed to convert any chances and did not look very threatening. What they did do very well though was battle, get first to the 50:50s (which Oxford did not seem to want to do), and give away the necessary little fouls needed to break up the U's passing. There's not really much more to say about the first half to be honest. Heslop set the ball up nicely on one occasion but blasted well over.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/leven.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;

		When Peter Leven came on the passing going forward improved (a bit).
		&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Seven minutes into the 2nd half Oxford conceded from a corner. Again. This time Andrew Davies scoring to put the Bantams 1 up. In previous matches this sort of thing has stirred on the yellow, but no such comeback looked on the cards today, even when subs were made, Leven replacing an ineffectual Heslop and Sean Rigg replacing debutant Luke O'Brien who had a reasonable game at left back. A second corner on 68 minutes gave Bradford a two goal cushion which Oxford were never going to come back from. A free header in the box fell nicely to Wells who had the simplest of tap ins.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Leven was unlucky not to score from a free kick which was well saved by McLaughlin, and Potter missed making firm contact from a Leven cross. The only other opportunity fell to Craddock who sliced horribly wide. So plenty of people left early, boos at full time from sections of the crowd, a fifth league defeat in a row, and a difficult away fixture up at Rotherham next week. Wimbledon the following Tuesday is already starting to look like a relegation clash.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Batt, Raynes, O'Brien (Leven 62), Cox, Heslop (Rigg 62), Capaldi, Potter, Constable, Craddock.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Cox, Constable. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bradford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; McLaughlin, Meredith, Davies, Oliver, McArdle, Reid (Hines 82), Atkinson, Jones, Doyle, Hanson, Wells (Thompson 70).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Hanson. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
I honestly can't really single out any player as having made a better contribution than any other (or any contribution at all). Clarke made a few half-decent saves, O'Brien didn't do much wrong before making way for a more attacking option. Lee Cox was the least worst of the midfield.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Bradford kept themselves in the play-offs today, moving up from 5th to 4th. They didn't show anything which suggests they are promotion candidates today, except for getting an easy win. I'm sure they are capable of playing much better, though they did create plenty of chances. What they do have is great determination and battling qualities so they should continue to do well.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
League Two looked like a very boring division this afternoon. Gillingham moved further ahead at the top, Wimbleon won at Adam Park where I assume Wycombe fans are very angry at their team's start. Southend came back from 0-1 down to win against Exeter and climbed to 8th. Plymouth turned around a two goal defecit at the Globe Arena, beating Morecambe with three goals in the last 18 minutes, including 2 penalties.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What a genuine priviledge to watch this game of football. The momentum of the games twisted and turned it way through the 97 minutes until Rovers had the decisive goals. It is a long time since I last was in the ground at a good Rovers performance, and this will rate as one of my all time favourite Rovers performances and matches.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Rovers made the worst possible start, conceding within 45 seconds to the impressive Adomah. Despite going 0-1 down Rovers played good passing football, and kept their patience. The tide started to turn and after half an hour a defensive mistake led to Jordan Rhodes being clear through on goal. His composed finish equalised the score and showed how good this player will be in the Championship this season. It was his first for the club in his second game. Rovers continued to dominate in spells and looked favourites to go on to win. A set back was the loss of two defenders to injury before half time: Marcus Olsson and Gael Givet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-right-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/gomes.jpg'/&gt;
		Nuno Gomes took a great strike on the turn to put Rovers in front. He didn't put a foot wrong all match, but did tire towards the end.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ten minutes into the second half Nuno Gomes put Rovers 2-1. With his back to goal, he turned and put in a low shot and the comeback had happened. Rovers kept pressing forward and looked likely to get a third, but Heaton in goal was in good form. Rovers then sat back and defended too deeply, inviting City on. Pearson stunned the away support to make it 2-2, finishing with great accuracy after another devestating run from Adomah.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/rochina.jpg'/&gt;
		Ruben Rochina came on and got what looked like a winner, creating a chance all by himself and picking out the top left corner superbly.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rochina came on for Gomes and looked dangerous. He ran at the Bristol back four, finsing himself in the box but further progress was blocked by numbers around him. He composed himself, found enough space to get away a shot, and stuck it well out of the keeper's reach with his left foot. An unbelievable game at this point and surely Rovers would not win with only 10 minutes to go. Bristol City continued to look threatening going forward and Baldock scored a couple of minutes lack to silence the travelling fans. Another very accurate shot out of reach of Paul Robinson, but defensively the outfield players should have done more to prevent this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Five minutes went up on the fourth official's board. Never before have I been more confident that Rovers had enough to outscore their opponents. It just seemed destined to happen. A free kick swung in by Pedersen fell to Dann in the box and his 92nd minute goal into the bottom left corner was enough. Football doesn't get any better than this. Well until the 95 minute. Rhodes was alone on the edge of the box. He continued with the ball but the keeper had the goal well covered and the defender was showing him nothing of the net to aim at. So Rhodes curled the ball into the only place where it could find the back of the net. 5-3 and there was no coming back from this. The scoreline reflected what a well balanced, free-flowing game of football this was. Very little in the way of fouls, no cards given, 50:50 possession, and what chances there were were accurate and efficiently dispatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Rovers now top of the table and playing excellent football at a high tempo set by tika-taka passing from Murphy and Etuhu, I am confident this will be a good season. Tickets for Charlton and Nottingham Forest away are being ordered...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bristol City Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Heaton, Foster, Fontaine, Carey, Cunnigham, Woodford (Anderson 84), Skuse, Pearson, Adomah, Stead (Baldock 63), Taylor (Davies 71).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Blackburn Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Robinson, Orr, Givet (G Hanley 37), Dann, Ribeiro, Pedersen, Murphy, Marcus Olsson (Martin Olsson 22), Etuhu, Rhodes, Nuno Gomes (Rochina 78).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/rhodes.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Jordan Rhodes showed why Rovers spent £8M on him at the close of the transfer window. His link up play with Nuno Gomes was superb, and the two are forming a good understanding and partnership in only their 2nd game together. Both finishes were top class and he was in the thick of the action all game. Other chances he had were denied only by excellent saves from Heaton in goal.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/bristol-city.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Bristol City are an exciting team to watch. They are direct and fast in their counter attacks and Adomah caused problems for Rovers. Though defensively they are weak and against teams with attacking quality they will struggle. They may well stay up this season but I'm not expecting them to be challenging anwhere near the top.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='ground-photo-right'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tour: Ashton Gate, Bristol&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Ashton Gate is an old fashioned stadium, each stand built as a stand alone piece of architecture. The Wedlock Stand is a singing terrace, furnished with token unbacked seats which no one uses. On the left stand the away fans, on the right stand the most vocal home fans. This close proximity of the fans makes the atmosphere electric, and the pitched roof reflects the sound back into the stand, creating unrivalled acoustics. The home fans sing to the away fans but they are focussed mainly on the game. This is in contrast to when I went to Northampton and the home fans there were more interested in abusing the away following than actually watching any football. Another thing that makes City a good away day is that many of the pubs seemed to have a good mix of home and away support and football shirts were not banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/competitions/npower-championship.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Blackpool slipped to second after failing to beat Barnsley, Tom Ince's quality earning them a point. Bolton got a vital win against Watford, while Burnley came back from 2-1 down to beta Peterborough 5-2, who now are rooted to the bottom with 5 defeats out of 5. Hull, Brighton, Cardiff and Nottingham Forest all won and are all in the play-off spots.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford United fell to a second-straight league defeat, conceding seven goals along the way. It was also their first defeat at home this season. The U's got off to a decent enough start but when Cureton pick up the ball from just inside the home team's half, Jake Wright didn't know whether to mark him or the other runner. Wright was caught in no-man's land and Cureton lashed a spectacular strike into the top left corner. The second goal was controversial: A low cross was stopped by Clarke on the goal line. It wasn't even a difficult decision, it was obvious to everyone in the stadium that the ball as was in play. The linesman had other ideas and gave a corner. What was more inexcusable was Oxford's poor defending, allowing Bennett a free header. Exeter deserved their two goal cushion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Exeter made it 0-3 after 50 minutes when Cureton again worked a piece of individual magic. Only then did the Oxford comeback start. Oxford now had their best 10 minute spell all season, tearing apart a very good side. Batt took the ball into the box and was felled, Forster-Caskey converting the spot kick. Continual pressure saw Potter score from close range. Deane Smalley then had a chance to complete an unlikely comeback, but headed over the bar, unmarked, 2 yards out. Continuing to push forward, Oxford were caught on the break, offering little in the way of defence to gift O'Flynn a fourth for his team.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/forster-caskey.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
Forster-Caskey scored his second of the season from the penalty spot after Batt was brought down.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The appauling linesman had one last impact on the game, killing off any chance of further entertainment in the game by flagging for an off-the-ball incident. The Exeter player fell to the floor like a sack of spuds after zero contact from Beano who had been booked less than 60 seconds previously. The red card means he will miss Burton next Saturday and is unappealable being a double booking. It had no impact on who deserved to win the game, but this linesman should be disciplined by the FA, he was awful and in a tighter game he would have a negative impact on a result.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Batt, Raynes, Wright, Capaldi, Chapman, Heslop (Craddock 55), Rigg (Pittman 60), Forster-Caskey [1], Smalley (Constable 73), Potter [1].&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Forster-Caskey, Constable. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; Constable. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Exeter Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Krysiak, Woodman, Bennett, Baldwin, Coles, Amankwaah, Sercombe, Oakley, Davies, Cureton (Bauza 57), O'Flynn (Doherty 84).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Woodman. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Not sure any of the Oxford players deserved this, so it has to be Jamie Cureton of Exeter.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/exeter.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Exeter are a great team. They will deserve to go up if they continue to play like they did today. In 2 and a bit years of watching League Two football, I can safely say that Exeter were the best team to have ever shown up. It would have been no great shame to lose to them if it hadn't been for inexcusable defensive errors which simply made their job easier for them. Jamie Cureton will get goals all season for them and is that extra bit of class needed to get out of this division.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Gillingham remained top of the league with an easy win at Barnet. Port Vale hammered Rotherham 6-2. Fleetwood enjoyed a big derby win at Morecombe. Other teams to pick up wins were Southend, Burton, and Northampton.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford United recorded a third straight win over rivals Swindon Town thanks to Alfie Potter's late 88th minute winner. Sw*ndon came into the game on the back of an embarassing 4-1 defeat at Preston North End, a team not exactly endowed with form at the moment. Di Canio had managed to wind up yet another member of his playing staff by subbing keeper Wes Foderingham early in the first half, with the goalie having to make a public apology to keep his job. Oxford's good form combined with a League One opponent in indifferent form created an even and entertaining match. On balance the higher division team were probably the slightly better side, creating twice as many chances, but squandering just as many. Oxford raised their game and were deservedly still in the game as the final whistle approached. It looked like it was going straight to penalties, but sub Potter had the final say. Swindon defenders Ward and Flint collided when trying to head the same ball. Full credit to Beano who latched onto the loose ball, took it into the box, before squaring perfectly to the unmarked Potter who made no mistake.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/potter.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
Alfie Potter scored his second of the season against the unmentionables.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is a rare occasion when a 1st round Johnstone's Paint Trophy match can generate a crowd in excess of 7000 and create such a thrilling atmosphere. Though this is down to the regionalisation of the early rounds which has been a clever move by the organisers. Next round: Away at Cheltenham.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Batt, Raynes, Wright, Capaldi, Boateng (Potter 52), Chapman, Forster-Caskey, Constable, Pittman, Craddock (McGinty 90).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Raynes. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Swindon Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Foderingham, Devera, Bessone, Ward, Ferry (Miller 66), McCormack, Coke (Flint 81), Benson (Bostock 66), Williams, De Vita, Rooney.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/constable.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
While James Constable did not really get involved in chances on goal, his physicality and bullishness created uncertainty in Swindon's defence, key for the mistake leading to the only goal of the game.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/swindon.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Di Canio's team was significantly changed from their defeat at Preston, but he doesn't accept hangers on, so on paper this team should have still won today. They didn't. Swindon fans were poor, rarely singing all game.
&lt;/div&gt;

I could look up the other results from the 1st round if I wanted to but I simply don't care enough. The only important game was here, at the Kassam. And we won it.

At the start of 2012 I enjoyed MITx's &lt;a href='blog.php?tag=6.002x'&gt;6.002x&lt;/a&gt; online course on circuits and electronics. This autumn (or fall if you are Atlantically-challenged) there are seven courses available online, offered by MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley. The three big players in the American university scene have combined forces under the name '&lt;a href='http://www.edx.org' target='blank'&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt;'. 6.002x is available again, and new courses are Solid State Chemistry, Software as Service, Artificial Intelligence, Quantitative Methods in Health Research, and MIT's Computer Science and Programming.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have chosen to do Harvard's &lt;a href='https://www.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x/2012/about' target='blank'&gt;Introduction to Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; as it looks a little more advanced than MIT's from the description, and covers a wider range of programming languages. The course starts on the 15th October and can be completed any time before 15th April. There are 9 programming assignments of 15-20 hours each, 2 quizzes, and a final project, all of which will build up to an honor code certificate.

&lt;p&gt;
Over the last couple of days I dug out the code for my podcasting website, &lt;a href='http://www.physicasts.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Physicasts&lt;/a&gt;, and started work on it with a view to completing it before the weekend. I am pleased that I have done exactly this. Some of the overall design is based heavily on the BBC's podcast website, the design of which I am a big fan of. The podcast tabs on the index page were generated from code from &lt;a href='http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex17/featuredcontentglider.htm' target='blank'&gt;Dynamic Drive&lt;/a&gt;, called a Featured Content Glider. I adapted the CSS to customise the tabs, shape, and colours.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am now ready to start adding podcasts to the website and to start advertising this to students as soon as the first podcast is up. I will have a go at recording this first podcast tomorrow, which is a Year 10 podcast called &quot;Making Things Hot&quot;.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I drove the relatively short trip of 1 hour to Milton Keynes tonight to watch my first 'live' match of Rovers since the 0-2 defeat to Stoke two years ago. I watch a significant nubmer of games last year on TV and the internet, but this was my first chance to see some of the newer signings and experience the crowd's mood. Atmosphere was lacking for two reasons: 1) It was the second round of the Capital One Cup at MK, 2) Steve Kean and Venky's has literally sucked the soul out of the supporters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-left-rovers'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/rovers/goodwillie.jpg'/&gt;
		David Goodwillie scored Rovers' only goal and looked hungry for goals when he came on.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	A second string team was played with the main aim this season rightly being promotion from the Championship. You would expect these fringe players to want to play well to try to force their way into the team on a regular basis. You would particuarly expect this of the likes of Ruben Rochina and David Goodwillie. The senior players to give some solidity were Orr, Dann, and Etuhu. I am disappointed to say that the majority of the fring players did not make an impression and did not win over any fans tonight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In goal, Jake Kean kept us in it with some good saves in the first half to make up for defenders being unable close down Dons attackers properly. There was too much backing off in defence and little good tackling. Bradley Orr was solid all game and was a reliable player. Scott Dann and Grant Hanley were poor, made mistakes, and looked unsure how to deal with attacking runs. At left back Marcus Olsson was fairly absent for most of the match and was beaten by his man too many times. He provided little going forward and was lucky to not be brought off.
&lt;p&gt;
In the first half the midfield was ok, Vukcevic wanted to get involved, while Dickson Etuhu was a class above every other player on the park. He sat in front of the back four and swept up everything, every little loose ball. He never gave the ball away, and when he picked it up he kept the tempo flowing and delivered penetrating passes to either wing. Soon after Rovers went 1-0 to Luke Chadwick's first of the evening, Etuhu was taken off, a decision unpopular with fans including myself. Without Etuhu the midfield looked weak, it did not protect the defender who frankly needed protecting tonight. Fabio Nunes doesn't seem to understand the pace or physicality of the English game yet and is not the sort of player you want on Tuesday night at lower league opposition. I would keep him in the reserves until he improves these aspects of the game and want to show a bit more committment. His only real positive contribution was the assist for Rovers' only goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Up front Edinho Junior and Rochina didn't test the keeper enough. Rochina was particularly poor on this occasion, before coming off for Formica. Edinho was replaced by Goodwillie who I was very surprised not to see on the starting lineup. Given the full 90 I think he would have had a real go at their defenders and given 100% as he is not getting starting opportunities in the league at the moment. MK were excellent going forward but there was always a hint that if tested their defence might crumble, when they gave the ball away to not particularly physical Rovers' forwards. Goodwillie's goal came from an unchallenged cross from Nunes and a relatively simple header which you might expect to be defended better. If we'd had more than a pathetic 4 shots on target we would have won this one. Compared to MK Dons' 11 shots Rovers lacked the enterprise and ambition going forward, happy to pass it back to the back four, even at two-nil down. At the time when we most needed goals, our tempo was at it's lowest and MK were able to keep the ball under minimal pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Conclusions: Foreign youngsters win you nothing. Steven Kean is unable to even do the simple job of making sensible substitutions when a game needs to be won. Dickson Etuhu must be kept fit and play every game this season for Rovers to go up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MK Dons Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Martin, Otsemobor, MacKenzie, Chicksen, Willians, Gleeson, Potter, Powell, Chadwick (O'Shea 77), Bowditch (Ibehre 90), MacDonald (Lowe 74)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Blackburn Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Kean, Orr, Dann, G Hanley, Ms Olsson, Jorge, Etuhu (Lowe 58), Vukcevic, Nunes, Edinho Junior (Goodwillie 58), Rochina (Formica 69)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Of the Rovers players there wasn't much choice today. Only given 58 minutes Dickson Etuhu was the player who kept us in the first half and would have been our best way of keeping the ball moving when we needed two goals in the second half.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
MK Dons are an impressive outfit, they play the ball well, and have good pace in attack. They have confidence in their own abilities and no doubt they will be up at the top of League One again this season. With that division looking less strong than it did last season I would expect them to go up into the Championship.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tour: Stadium:MK&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
The newly built stadium in Milton Keynes is a great fan experience. Currently there are two tiers (but it is expandable to three) though only the bottom tier had seats. The top tier is having seats installed for the start of next season to increase the capacity, just in time for them to most likely be a Championship club. Around the outside of the ground it is a bit of a construction site, but inside I would rate it as the best stadium I have been to in terms of facilities. Seats are very confortable, and big with lot of space to walk past people in your row. The aisles are wide too and the food is reasonably priced. I love how you can overlook the stadium from the concourse at half time. My only criticism would be the lack of urinals in the gents, meaning that unnecessary queues built up (even though less than half of the seats were occupied in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://360.io/HtW5vX' target='blank'&gt;See the panorama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Shocks in round 2 came from Crawley coming from behind to beat Bolton, Coventry dumping out their neightbours Birmingham, Leicester doing the same to their rivals Leicester, and Swindon beating Stoke 4-3 in extra time in a match which had 41 shots over the 120 minutes. Oxford lost 3-0 away at Leeds at a team with too much quality and will be pushing for a place in the Premier League next season. Preston and Burnley both went through to make Rovers exit look even worse.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford United maintained their 100% record in all competitions with another win to remain top of League Two. Chris Wilder opted to go withe same team and same formation (4-4-2) that started the excellent second half against Southend on Tuesday night. Tom Craddock started brightly, curling a shot just over the bar in the first fee minutes. Plymouth's Hourihane caused problems in central midfield twisting and turning his way into the box only to set up an offside goal. Sean Rigg was United's best creative oulet, providing runs and tempting crosses and causing no end of problems for Nelson at right back. In the 20th minute his hard work in winning a ball in the corner of the pitch set up Craddock's shot which deflected into the path of an unmarked Deane Smalley who scored his first of the season. Just reward for his ball-winning in the air.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/rigg.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
Sean Rigg played well down the left and set up the first goal.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Smalley and Potter were often 2 on 1 and Smalley's perfect runs offered great passing opportunities for Potter. the minutes after the first Potter broke free, overpassed it to Smalley, but the number 10 placed it past the oncoming Cole from a tight angle. 2-0. Now thunder started, the heavens opened and the game settled down. Plymouth played it around well but failed to create any further chances of note.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second half was characterised by substitutions: Oxford's were bad and Argyle's were good. Wilder revealed in his post-match interview that Smalley had a groin niggle and Forster-Caskey came off as the result of what he called a 'very poor challenge' from behind just before half time. Beano came on for Deano and Heslop came on for Forster-Caskey but I felt that both contributed poorly. Oxford's passing started sloppily and the lack of tempo invited Argyle on. Oxford's only chance in the opening stages when Constable put Craddock through but he shot over.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Argyle switched their two full backs, preventing Oxford's attacks and providing good options forward. Robbie Williams pulled one back from a superb low free kick around the wall, no chance for Clarke. Pittman had a chance well saved, while Hourihane went down embarassingly trying to win a penalty. Plymouth had a few more chances but none were good enough to score. So Oxford hold on to stay top of the league but the feeling was more one of relief at the final whistle. Wilder refused to be critical of the players who came on, and while it was difficult watching in the final 45 minutes, I think fans should see the positives: we have not conceded from open play in the first four consecutive matches, we can tear opponents apart when we need to, and players who were average last season have stepped up their game significantly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Batt, Raynes, Wright, Capaldi, Potter, Chapman, Forster-Caskey (Heslop 46), Rigg, Smalley [2](Constable 46), Craddock (Pittman 67).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; None. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plymouth Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Cole, Nelson (Berry 46), Purse (Chadwick 71), Blanchard, Bhasera, Young, Wooton, Hourihane, Gurrieir (Williams [1] 46), Cowan-Hall, Feeney.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Bhasera, Berry, Williams. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/smalley.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Dean Smalley only got 45 minutes of football today, taken off due to the scoreline and as a precaution with groin worries. He won every header that was sent his way. His runs were intelligent. He brought others into play well. Most importantly he finished off two chances very well. His confidence will grow, if fit he will start the next game, and hopefully he can start scoring regularly now after a poor first season last year.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/plymouth.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Plymouth Argle had made a bad start, carrying on from their decline last season (but they did stay up against all odds). home defeats to Aldershot and an away no score draw at Dagenham indicate this season will be a struggle for them. I still exoect them to be middle to bottom half this season but they can knock it around well enough to stay up comfortably. Nelson struggled against Rigg in the first 45, but the substitutes Berry and Williams were game changers and Carl Fletcher should take credit for turning the game around at the break. Williams has bags of experience at this level and looks like he should be starting games, rather than being on the bench.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/competitions/npower-league-two.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Exeter had a great 3-0 win away at Accrington, while Cheltenham, Bradford, Port Vale, and Gillingham all kept the pressure on with wins. Wimbledon's appauling start continued with a 5-1 defeat at Bradford. Fleetwood picked up their first win and I'm sure they will come good as the season progresses. Southend failed to win again, drawing 3-3 at Northampton. The luckiest and unluckiest teams of the day were Wycombe and Bristol Rovers respectively. Rovers were embarassing Wycombe 3-1 at Adams Park before the match was abandoned under a stormy sky after 66 minutes, when a bolt of lightning struck the Dream Stand!

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even before Southend had a player sent off, Oxford had dominated the early exchanges. A lot of early focus came through Forster-Caskey and Rigg on the left, Batt on the right, and long balls to Deane Smalley who was winning headers all night. Southend finally settled into their rhythmn and were making a good game of it. This was interrupted by Michael Timlin's first yellow card after 21 minutes which was full deserved after a committed, but late challenge. Then at 26 minutes Timlin tripped Lee Cox as he was breaking on the counter and received a second yellow. Both yellows were justified in the eyes of the law, though I was a little surprised to see a player sent of for collectively so little and felt some sympathy for the lad as he marched off from a game that could never be the same.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Southend naturally started timewasting, thought it was only really Cameron Belford between the sticks who was doing this. Their two banks of four sat back and looked organised and contained Oxford's attacks. What could be mistaken for a lack of ideas was actually clever patience, pinging the ball all around the park, waiting for mistakes, and tiring out the opponents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/craddock.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Tom Craddock marked a superb second half substitute's apperance with both goals in Oxford's win.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Wilder switched it to 4-4-2 from his usual 4-3-3 after half time, Tom Craddock coming on for Lee Cox who was playing well but sacrificed for the sake of the system. It worked really well. Craddock scored twice, on 53 minutes, Sean Rigg sending the ball across the penalty area and Craddock poking a foot out at it to send it into the net. Timewasting stopped and Southend had to come at the Oxford goal. This opened the game up and Oxford's counte attacks were exciting, purposeful, and looked threatening. In the 87th minute Craddock made it 2-0 after receiving the ball in the box from Rigg and firing low past Belford. It made the result more convincing even though the performance has already convinced the home fans that Wilder has brought in quality and is starting to get the best out of earlier signing. Even his tactical awareness was spot on tonight!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Alfie Potter was running the show, making his trademark runs with ease. Another trait which he showed today was his physical strength which doesn't at appear obvious. He was winning slide tackles, winning headers, and outmuscling opponents. A man of the match thoroughly deserved. Special mention to Tom Craddock who took his chance off the bench brilliantly. A certain to start on Saturday?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Let's make one thing absolutely clear, despite the provocative blog description, Southend will not be bottom of the league come May and will be challenging once again for promotion. Oxford's dominance tonight was only emphasised by what strong candidates for promotion Southend are. The fact that Paul Sturrock's job was already being taked about after a 0-1 defeat at home to Accrington Stanley shows what great expectation there is on them after last season's thrown away campaign.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
York's late equaliser at Morecambe, combined with Craddock's second lifted Oxford top of the league on goal difference. They are joined in the automatic places by Accrington (defining the critics) and Gillingham (superb result away at Wycombe). Rotherham beat promotion favourites Rotheram, while Torquay and Cheltenham had to settle for a point. Southend are the only team without a point now. Plymouth, Barnet, and Dagenham &#38; Redridge already fill up the lower places. Wimbledon finished last season poorly and a 6-2 defeat at Burton suggests they will be battling relegation this season.
&lt;/div&gt;

Lightbox2, by &lt;a href='http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/' target='blank'&gt;Lokesh Dhakar&lt;/a&gt; is an easy script to incorporate into a website. It displays images on top of your website and it's function is to provide a closer look at a picture by clicking on thumbnails. The script is completely free and only requires jquery, JavaScript, CSS, and a couple of image files. It is very easy to display images using Lightbox2, and I was able to convert the images in my blog to do so very quickly. By grouping images using a simple name tag they can be forced to display as an album which can be browsed through and closed, all without leaving the current webpage you are on. I also found the forum helpful where people explain how to mod Lightbox2 to do extra functions such as providing external links. The only mod I have used so far forces the image to change it's size to fit the screen so as to avoid scrolling. To see an example of how this works, take a look at &lt;a href='http://www.tinorace.co.uk/blog.php?no=63'&gt;Walk around Blaen Bran, Cwmbran&lt;/a&gt;, a previous blog post which has several image. Click on an image to see the album in action.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A late opening of the Football League season saw a great first day away victory at Bristol Rovers. It was classic away performance as two first half goals, followed by strong defending and good organisation gave the yellows the three points. Jake Forster-Caskey scored his first goal for the goal on his league debut, curling the ball into the top left corner. Oxford continued to look the better team after a bright opening half an hour. Rovers were limited to shots from distance which did not threaten Ryan Clarke's clean sheet. The one occasion they took advantage of poor Oxford defending lead to their goal being ruled out for offside. Still, it was not great to see two free headers in the box and Clarke will be grateful for the assistant's ruling as he made an uncharacteristic positional mistake as the free kick was delivered in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='player-photo-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/oxford/potter.jpg'/&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Alfie Potter's individual trickery created himself a fine goal.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Goal number two was a brilliant piece of counter attacking from Alfie Potter. Oxford fans have been used to seeing him pick up the ball in midfield and travel great distances unchallenged, but all too often the final result doesn't match the earlier hard work. This time Potter received the ball just inside the Bristol half, and ran towards the box. His progress was helped by a very clever run from Constable which allowed Alfie to shoot unchallenged, low and past the keeper.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristol Rovers made some early changes to tactics and personnel in the second half and looked more of a threat. The home support was good and helped tghem dominate possession, shots, and corners. The fact that Oxford contained this threat bodes really well for the rest of the season. There were no wobbles, no heart stopping moments, just good defence. The only criticism could be that when they gained possession it was wasted too quickly and the attacking threat and crowd could have been subdued more easily by holding on to the ball and frustrating Bristol this way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bristol Rovers Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Walker, Smith, Brown, Virgo, Paterson, Gill, Anyinsah (Broghammer 50), Brown (Norburn 70), Lund (Richard 49), Clarkson, Harrold&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Paterson. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='away-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Batt, Raynes, Wright, Capaldi, Chapman (Heslop 64), Forster-Caskey [1], Cox, Constable (Smalley 68), Rigg, Potter [1] (Craddock 77).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Booked:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Raynes, Capaldi. &lt;strong&gt;Sent off:&lt;/strong&gt; None.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Jake Forster-Caskey looks to have strengthed our midfield and is capable of special moments, such as his 20 yarder today.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/bristol-rovers.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Bristol Rovers have struggled against Oxford since the latter achieve promotion to the football league. They showed enough about them today to suggest they should be top half and sniffing around the play-offs. Their support never gave up and neither did their players.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='ground-photo-right'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Tour: The Memorial Ground&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
The Memorial Stadium, Bristol, is really a rugby ground. It contains a proper football stand, a racecourse grandstand, and and a collection of temporary stands, one even with a canvas roof! Rovers fans will be glad their new stadium has been given the go ahead. No alcohol is available for away fans in the ground. There is a supporters bar at the home end, though fans are able to drink outside and make use of the space behind this stand. I'm not entirely sure what they do if it's raining!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://360.io/eZvn5K' target='blank'&gt;See the panorama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-right'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/competitions/npower-league-two.jpg'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around the grounds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
The win was important as several promotion candidates posted three goal scorelines including Wycombe, Gillingham, Port Vale, and title favourites Rotherham. Accrington's shock win at Roots Hall will make Southend even more determined to come and get a result on Tuesday night.
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Potato and Onion Harvest 2012</title>
<description>The first crop of potatoes have done very well. Onion quality is still to be confirmed.</description>

&lt;p&gt;
On a typical British Summer Day I went out to dig up the first half of the potato crop, and harvest four of many onions. It was typical because at the end of harvesting I had to run inside as a strong thunderstorm started lasting about 20 minutes. From just 10 seed potatoes (see &lt;a href='http://www.tinorace.co.uk/blog.php?no=35'&gt;Easter Gardening&lt;/a&gt;), 3.43kg of edible potatoes have been produced, and this is just half of the total to be dug up. Not bad given that I didn't prepare or weed the ground that well.. The potatoes vary greatly in size from jacket potatos to tiny salad potatoes. I have already lifted four onion out of the 15 or so that are ready. Some of them bolted so I don't know how good they will be. The onion is the most versatile and useful ingredients in the kitchen and is used in every culture. Hopefully I can create some creative onion dishes and post the results here.
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Capital One Cup 2nd Round Draw</title>
<description>Oxford drawn away to Leeds, while Rovers will visit Stadium:MK</description>

&lt;p&gt;
The draw for the second round of the Capital One Cup took place this lunchtime. With the draw seeded, all of the lower league teams were guaranteed top money-making ties. Oxford United were drawn away to Championship Leeds United. Blackburn Rovers were handed an away tie too, at Stadium:MK against the MK Dons. All of the matches will be taking place week beginning 27th August. Both matches are tempting for me to go to, but I have decided I will travel to Milton Keynes to watch Rovers as I don't get to see them very often and it is a much shorter journey. I have been to Elland Road a few times in the 1990s, but have never been to Stadium:MK so its a chance to tick off another league venue.

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's been a long night at the Kassam Stadium, but one worth being at for the 3097 Oxford fans (not the 691 away fans). This match had no sign of being a pre-season friendly; it was played with full commitment from both sides. AFC Bournemouth were a good passing side, who play football in the right way. They created early chances and showed why they are in League One. Close range headers were sent other the bar, strikes inched past the post. Yet Oxford held their own and played equally impressive football, and matched their opponent's possession.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id='photo-left'&gt;

		&lt;/br&gt;The sun setting over the missing 'West Stand'. A continual problem for goalkeepers in the spring and summer months.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The U's starting line-up featured some new names. Michael Raynes, signed on a free from Rotherham made a solid debut and seems to be forming an effective partnership in central defence with Jake Wright. Sean Rigg and Jake Forster-Caskey created good crosses and attacking space, while Lee Cox on loan from Swindon was replaced by Dean Smalley partway through the second half. Two other players who were like new signings were Alfie Potter, returning from injury at the back end of last season, and Tony Capaldi, possibly the greatest ever left back to miss an entire season through injury. Possibly. Alfie troubled his opponents, and Capaldi looked decent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penalties in front of the East Stand. Well taken penalties from Craddock, Smalley, and Rigg put Oxford 3-2 up. Ryan Clarke saved yet another penalty, this time from Pugh who has earlier angered the crowed by overdramatic whinging to the referee. A save the home fans especially enjoyed. Chapman, then Grabban took it to 4-3, with Damien Batt stepping up to take the winning penalty. He sealed a Man of the Match performance defensively and push forward, by scorign the winning spot kick.

&lt;div id='photo-right'&gt;
		&lt;a href='img/blog/87/craddock-penalty.jpg' rel='lightbox' title='Substitute Tom Craddock scored the first penalty. Some fans were warning others to duck after he skied his last penalty here.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/87/craddock-penalty-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;Substitute Tom Craddock scored the first penalty. Some fans were warning others to duck after he skied his last penalty here.
&lt;/div&gt;

Five scored, and the yellows march through to the second round. Not the biggest upset of the first round, or even the night, but another indication that Oxford can mix it with the bigger boys. The draw will take place tomorrow at 12:30pm on Sky Sports News. It will be seeded, so a big match is guaranteed. The lowest placed seeded team from last season is Crystal Palace who finished 17th in the Championship.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='home-team'&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Oxford Team:&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke, Batt, Raynes, Wright, Capaldi, Chapman, Rigg, Forster-Caskey (Heslop 104), Cox (Smalley 67), Constable (Craddock 93), Potter.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of the Match:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Damien Batt was superb all game. He was defensively solid and caused problems for Bournemouth down the right wing. It was fitting that he should score the match-winning penalty.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id='report'&gt;
&lt;div id='club-badge-left'&gt;
		&lt;img src='img/football/clubs/bournemouth.png'/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opposition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
This competition is obviously not a priority for AFC Bournemouth, but they fielded a strong team and took the tie seriously. In attacks they looked like they were a division above Oxford and possessed good strength in the air. Up front they had some good chances but to be honest they should have finished them. It will be interesting to see whether this was an off-day for the strikers or if this is something that might make life difficult in League One this season.
&lt;/div&gt;

The main shock exits were Bristol City, Charlton, Cardiff (vs Northampton), Blackpool (vs Morecambe), and Derby who after leading 3-0 were brought back to 5-5 before losing 7-6 on penalties!

<title>Kayking the Hinksey Stream - Thames Loop</title>

This kayak trip started from The Fishes pub in North Hinksey, near Oxford. The route started by going downstream on &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinksey_Stream' target='blank'&gt;Hinksey Stream&lt;/a&gt;, turning back upstream on Weirs Mill Stream, joining the Thames heading into the city, then continuing upstream on Bulstake Stream, before rejoining Hinskey Stream and returning to the pub. I parked on the road outside &lt;a href='http://www.fishesoxford.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;The Fishes&lt;/a&gt; and walked through the field to the right of the pub where there is a ford providing an easy put in. There is access to the ford through a style and gate which was open and is about 50m further down the road. You can view the &lt;a href='http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/101342383' target='blank'&gt;MapMyRun route page&lt;/a&gt;, or see a 3D fly through below.

I wasn't sure what to expect at Hinksey stream. I had a good idea that it would not be straight forward due to vegetation and water depth. I had read a view articles (&lt;a href='http://www.songofthepaddle.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?33840-An-Oxford-Circuit-(Bulstake-Botley-Seacourt-Hinksey-amp-Castle-Mill-Streams)' target='blank'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://www.isiscanoecluboxford.co.uk/media/pastTrips/2010/10IsisTavern.php' target='blank'&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) about the stream and no one had said they had failed to navigate it (though some talked of taking scythes and and cutters to get through). After the ford the water depth was good enough, even though it was mid-August and there had not been a lot of rain in the last week in this area. The route continued to be narrow and obstacles exist such as ducking under branches, avoiding brambles and nettles, and surfing reed. These were not common enough to prevent the trip being enjoyable and there was nothing that couldn't easily be got past.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hinksey Stream is a relatively straight route. There are not many view of the area as the banks are too high to see over and densly vegetated. This is not why you should kayak down Hinksey Stream. You should do this because you can get away from everything and every one. Apart from a small party of kayakers who had stopped from brunch on the bank, you will not see anyone along the entire route. There are no paths along side it. No bridges across which are likely to have many people walking across. At the railway bridge turn left and go under it. You will be unlucky not to head a train thundering otherhead if you just wait a few minutes. You will then go under Abingdon Road bridge, then the Southern bypass. There are now two options to connect to the Thames. If you are going downsteam, continue on Hinksey Stream where you will join the Thames just north of a single track railway bridge. If you are going upstream, you can either continue as previously mentioned then turn upstream where you will meet Iffley Lock and the Isis Tavern. It would be worth a stop here as this pub can only be accessed by bike, foot, or boat. The shorter journey which I took turned upstream on Weirs Mill Stream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here the river widens out and is accessible to larger vessels such as barges. I went back under the noisy Southern Bypass and continued up to Weirs Lane bridge, where obviously there are weirs. I have no knowledge of the branches to the right, but I could not see easy and obvious bank access to carry around those weirs. Take the left branch and you will go past people fishing in their back garden. Once the houses have been left behind the land opens up and there is a less mechanical looking weir. It is simple a very wide drop, of about 50cm, and is is very wide. On the right there is an easy get out and it is only 2m to the other side to put in at the higher level. Now you are at the right level to join the Thames.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here is where you will see the most people of the journey, as people on footbridges stop to watch at the sight of a kayak on the Thames. I was amidst sculls, rowing boats, motor boats, and Salter's steamers. Now the duration of the paddling against the current was taking its toll and it was hard work heading into Oxford. On the right, Christ Church Meadow. Up ahead, Folly Bridge. Here is the Head of the River pub which does not have access, but there is a punt hire pontoon which would allow you access to the pub. I didn't ask if you can get out here as I didn't want to stop. To go under Folly bridge, either left or right are both fine, though the left channel offers more interesting view, particularly of the buildings on Folly Island. Look out for the tower like building which has had turrets fitted on it! Going through Grandpont the area has a history of railway and industry though not obvious at first. On the left is a crane used for loading boats. The footbridge which is a bridge on a bridge originally carried gas pipes to the gas works which was on the north bank.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once under the modern day railway bridge there is a footbridge on the left over &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulstake_Stream' target='blank'&gt;Bulstake Stream&lt;/a&gt;, which is the final part of the return leg. The stream was flowing surpringly fast. On the right is the industrial area of Osney Mead. This gives way to scenery like I first found on Hinksey Stream. Narrow water, high vegetation, low branches. The turn off for Hinksey Stream on the left was smaller than I though it would be. I originally though it was a different waterway and kept going past it, but turned around when the route just 'felt wrong'. That and using MapMyRun showed me clearly that I had taken the wrong route. The pub was only a minute or two away now. For the first time on the entire journey the route became impassible. It was a good job that on the right was the car park for the pub I started at and it had a path through. So I couldn't return to the ford I started at but it was near enough. I walked into the Fishes in hope of a pint... but it was some stupid art festival and it was Sunday lunchtime. I didn't seem to be getting served at the bar soon, so I went home.

<description>The Palace of Knossos and Heraklion town</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Our last day in Crete. We visited the ancient Minoan Palace of &lt;a href='http://www.ancient-greece.org/archaeology/knossos.html' target='blank'&gt;Knossos&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, and then finished in &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraklion' target='blank'&gt;Heraklion&lt;/a&gt; town centre before flying home. The guide book suggested going early or late to Knossos as it would be cooler and also you would miss the queues. Well it wasn't wrong. We arrived at 9:30am and there was already a hefty queue forming and the car park was filling out nicely. The place opens at 8am and if you can get there at that time, it is definitely worth it. On leaving at midday the queue stretched a very long way. Early starts will avoid the queues and also miss the mass-group tours led through the site. I can only assume the tours are free, but walking around in a massive group isn't my thing, I'd prefer to go around at my own pace (i.e. faster). We found the key was to go where the groups were not. The tours conveniently kept the majority of people together in certain locations at any one time, so the rest of the place was not too bad to go around. We started by queuing for the throne room, and then walked around taking photos, looking at the mix of original ruins and reconstruction work by &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Evans' target='blank'&gt;Arthur Evans&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally reading the info boards. There are mixed opinions on the reconstruction work done, but I personally think it helps you get a better idea of what the Palace was like when it was lived in, so this can only be a good thing. The site is much larger than Phaistos and it definitely the most 'must-see' attraction on Crete, but is certainly more touristy than its quieter sibling. Avoid the shops and restaurants opposite. They are over-priced. This was the only example of business trying to fleece tourists I saw all holiday (except for at the airport which was worse). In general Cretans are happy for your trade and will charge a fair price for souvenirs, drinks, and food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Running on fumes now as I did not want to have to add any petrol to the tank at this stage, we headed back to the airport where we parked the car in the rental place. The drive into Heraklion was slow past one of two hospitals the town has (they are open on alternate days, obviously). The road was just a series of roundabouts, and despite being dual carriageway, the parked cars meant it was just one lane. The bus from the airport to town is reasonably priced. They charge per journey, so single journeys are not punished compared to returns unlike in the UK. Make sure you buy from a kiosk before boarding though or you will pay extra. The bus arrived in Heraklion and we went for lunch at Minos restaurant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;a href='http://www.heraklion-crete.org/archaeological-museum/' target='blank'&gt;Heraklion Archaeological Museum&lt;/a&gt; is the place to see all of the best finds from Phaistos and Knossos. Sadly the museum shut for renovation in 2007 and in 2012 is still not open. The most important exhibits are on display at a temporary exhibition not far from the original museum location. While I have not seen the original to compare, the temporary place lacks any atmosphere and it too contemporary a setting for ancient relics. Visitors must not touch the glass or even the building's walls, or one of several man-like women will say 'do not touch'. Don't even dream of talking any louder than a whisper or these same women will very loudly shout 'Do not talk so loudly' without a hint of irony. The artefacts on display are impressive and there is plenty of information on each one. The best is the Phaistos Disc, a record of the Linear B script which has yet to be deciphered. A replica fridge magnet (only â¬1) now proudly adorns my fridge).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other highlights of Heraklion are the harbour wall which we walked along before dinner and the market street where we bought 1 litre of raki â¬13 (cheaper than supermarkets). I was keen to spend the rest of the time sat by a pool, but this was not easy to find. A quick check of the internet showed that Astoria Hotel, close to where we got off the bus, has a 4th floor rooftop pool bar. The entry is free to non-residents, but drinks are expensive. There is no pressure put on you to buy their food and drinks whilst using their sun loungers though (but I wouldn't recommend openly eating your own food!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And so a really great holiday in Crete had to come to an end. Heraklion airport is nothing like UK airports. If ever you whinge at the security and queues at Heathrow, wait until you have been here and then you'll understand that such complaining at UK airports is pathetic in comparison. Even their duty free is expensive compared to Birmingham. The flight home was quiet, so while we were given the cheap seats with poor leg room, as soon at the seat belt signs went off we upgraded ourselves to the comfy seats at the front.

<description>WaterCity water park and Skotino Cave</description>

&lt;p&gt;

Our last full day in the area of Hersonissos. We went to &lt;a href='http://www.watercity.gr/' target='blank'&gt;WaterCity&lt;/a&gt;, a water park situated a long way from any town and up on high land in the hills. By driving there early we were able to get into the park first. Tt helped that most people then immediately queued for lockers but we went for sunbed and rings. We were first on the rides while other faffed. Importantly getting rings early saved a lot of time queuing. Before a strict policy of giving away the ring after going on the ride was loosely enforced, it was difficult to acquire rings as selfish people kept them. Some even put them on empty sunbeds. These people are literally worse than Hitler. Even when tough rules came in as the park filled up, a German family held onto their rings despite my comments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The park has an excellent selection of rides, though my only criticism would be that the lazy river is just too lazy. My top tip is to wear socks. They will get wet which is a good thing as the walkways can be too hot in that sort of climate. Make sure you go on the zip wire well before 3pm as this is when the wave machine starts and the zip wire closes. There were some very unhappy looking people, but...well... tough I wanted waves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once the waves finished we headed for &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skotino_cave' target='blank'&gt;Skotino Cave&lt;/a&gt; (aka Agia Paraskevi Cave). It is vaguely sign posted, and the entrance if on a dirt track down from a church in the middle of nowhere. The short walk into the cave is like something from Tomb Raider. There are bats and pigeons living in a massive opening in the ground. The cave is very big and requires a head torch to really get the most out of it. I climbed down into the echoic chasm and explored around. The temperature was the coolest all week and this was a real highlight of the holiday.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;embed type='application/x-shockwave-flash' src='https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf' width='100%' height='500'flashvars='host=picasaweb.google.com&#38;captions=1&#38;noautoplay=1&#38;hl=en_US&#38;feat=flashalbum&#38;RGB=0x000000&#38;feed=https&#37;3A&#37;2F&#37;2Fpicasaweb.google.com&#37;2Fdata&#37;2Ffeed&#37;2Fapi&#37;2Fuser&#37;2F118096171165979216353&#37;2Falbumid&#37;2F5771714577835624305&#37;3Falt&#37;3Drss&#37;26kind&#37;3Dphoto&#37;26hl&#37;3Den_US' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer'&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our last dinner was in Piskopiano, the village where we started the holiday by watching Cretan dancing. We had spotted a great deal on a mixed fish platter for two and we rewarded with great views over Hersonissos and its bay. It was washed down with a carafe of retsina (the first of the week) and the now customary, free raki.

<description>Boat trip to Sissi</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Grateful for a later start this morning we walked back to harbour and chose the 'El Greco' boat trip for â¬20 each. First stop St. George's cave where you can jump off the side of boat, a lot higher than I thought it would be. We attempted to snorkel but the visibility was very poor and we were not there very long. Was it all the boats maybe that had reduced the visibility?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align='center'&gt;
&lt;iframe width='420' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZP-2sc-ndxw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;embed type='application/x-shockwave-flash' src='https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf' width='100%' height='500'flashvars='host=picasaweb.google.com&#38;captions=1&#38;noautoplay=1&#38;hl=en_US&#38;feat=flashalbum&#38;RGB=0x000000&#38;feed=https&#37;3A&#37;2F&#37;2Fpicasaweb.google.com&#37;2Fdata&#37;2Ffeed&#37;2Fapi&#37;2Fuser&#37;2F118096171165979216353&#37;2Falbumid&#37;2F5771714756344066609&#37;3Falt&#37;3Drss&#37;26kind&#37;3Dphoto&#37;26hl&#37;3Den_US' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer'&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then the boat went to &lt;a href='http://www.explorecrete.com/crete-east/sissi-crete.htm' target='blank'&gt;Sissi&lt;/a&gt; across the bar, a journey of about 1 hour. The boat was very bumpy. I don't normally get travel sick, but I can admit to feeling nauseous on this journey and I wasn't the only one. We had two hours at the harbour town of Sissi. I had a quick lunch at Skippers consisting of big beer and toast. There was some excellent swimming and snorkelling here, and great views of waves crashing against the harbour break. It is a windy route from the harbour to the beach so it was just quicker to swim across. The main shops and restaurants are not on the beach side anyway. There was another opportunity to jump off the boat before leaving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align='center'&gt;
&lt;iframe width='420' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/dx6ddTvnJyw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Im just grateful that this sequence of badly-shot videos of a boat leaving Sissi didn't happen to our boat!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align='center'&gt;

&lt;iframe width='420' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Isvbt_2LCcw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to Hersonnisos, the crossing was still bumpy but better this time around. We got back just before 5pm and broke up the journey on the way home by stopping at the &lt;a href='http://www.palmbeachclub.gr' target='blank'&gt;Palm Beach Club&lt;/a&gt;, a free entry pool bar. Every day at 5pm they have an outdoor foam party. We weren't their best customers; we sat on the fancy loungers and didn't buy any drinks before our long walk back to the hotel.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hoping to avoid it being busy we set off for &lt;a href='http://www.cretaquarium.gr/indexen.php' target='blank'&gt;CretAquarium&lt;/a&gt;. Well... once I had found the car keys which turned out to be in the car door from yesterday. Entrance is â¬12. Sharks, turtles, jellyfish, stingrays, starfish, anything you can think of, they have (but not a whale, which would just be silly). Everything is indoors, in darkly lit corridors with brightly lit tanks, bringing out the colours more vividly. We were armed with two cameras, my DSLR and my iPhone. Without going into a manual mode the DSLR struggled to get good focus on the images it took under the unusual lighting conditions. The iPhone on the other hand. Well that took its most spectacular photos it has ever taken. Ever colour was as good as real life (if not better). Every image was in perfect focus. I don't know how it does it, but it was able to compensate for and even bask in the difficult light. The photos in the album below are my favourite from the entire holiday. My most favourite being the jellyfish.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;embed type='application/x-shockwave-flash' src='https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf' width='100%' height='500'flashvars='host=picasaweb.google.com&#38;captions=1&#38;noautoplay=1&#38;hl=en_US&#38;feat=flashalbum&#38;RGB=0x000000&#38;feed=https&#37;3A&#37;2F&#37;2Fpicasaweb.google.com&#37;2Fdata&#37;2Ffeed&#37;2Fapi&#37;2Fuser&#37;2F118096171165979216353&#37;2Falbumid&#37;2F5771717372623376081&#37;3Falt&#37;3Drss&#37;26kind&#37;3Dphoto&#37;26hl&#37;3Den_US' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer'&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the exhibit there was a video about life on the abyssal plain. It was a BBC documentary, dubbed in Greek, then subtitled with English. I had been aware of how life survived in the absence of sun in the food chain, but wasn't aware of quite how abundant or weird it was. After leaving the aquarium we went to the climate change exhibition in the exhibition centre close by as it was included in the admission. We then tried to drive to Skotino Cave but got lost too many times, so we'll give that a go another day. Instead I was happy to chill by the pool at our hotel with an audio book and a beer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the evening we walked in search of dinner out towards the harbour and then along the harbour wall. It was here we found the various boat trips. I was kind of glad for the complete lack of choice in destination. It made the decision simple. You can go on a boat at 11am to St George's Bay, then to Sissi, then back for 5pm. Or you can do exactly the same on a pirate boat. Or you can go on two other boats that does the same journey at the same times. Or you can go on a different boat which does the same journey but in reverse to avoid the other tourists. We then went to a bar offering two cocktails for â¬8. So we order one each and got four. Erm... we sent two back, be careful here, they interpret 2-4-1s in a different way to us!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For dinner we found a place offering a chicken grill, mixed salad, and wine for two for â¬19. The free raki at the end of the meal was huge. At the Irish bar &lt;a href='http://www.shenanigans.gr/' target='blank'&gt;Shenanigans&lt;/a&gt;, we got a free shot with big beer. At another bar they were offering 2 free shots and half price cocktails, and best of all absolutely no entrance fees to clubs or bars. Plus they don't put the lights on at 11pm and tell you to drink up!
&lt;/p&gt;

Another day, another drive. This time to the south-western tip of the Heraklion prefecture. This was the further drive of the holiday, starting with dual carriageway to Heraklion, a well built, quiet, and straight single carriageway road, then windy roads through villages and mountains to get to &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaistos' target='blank'&gt;Phaistos&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the second most important Minoan ruin on the island and where the famous &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaistos_disc' target='blank'&gt;Phaistos Disc&lt;/a&gt; was found (a record of ancient Linear B script). Minoan palaces date from around 1800BCE to 1300BCE though were not just posh residences for powerful people. They were working palaces and served as administrative centres for each region. This palace has no reconstructions, just the original ruins as first excavated in 1874.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before leaving the UK I bought a second-hand &lt;a href='http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Tamron-70-300mm-f-4-5.6-Di-VC-Lens-Review.aspx' target='blank'&gt;Tamron telephoto lens&lt;/a&gt; for my Canon 1000D DSLR camera. It has a focal range of 70-300mm, which is significantly greater than the lens which came with the camera 4 years ago. This was the first opportunity I had to properly try it out. You can see some examples in the photo album below. The photo I am most pleased with was a macro shot of a praying mantis which was happily sat on a rock.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A short drive south took us to the monastery of &lt;a href='http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Monasteries/Heraklion-Monasteries/odigitria-monastery-near-sivas/' target='blank'&gt;Odigitria&lt;/a&gt;. It's a working monastery which is free to enter. The buildings are maintained in excellent condition and the interiors are beautifully painted. The main reason to visit here is to climb the &lt;a href='http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Towers/Heraklion-Towers/xopateras-tower-in-odegetria-monastery/' target='blank'&gt;Xopateras Tower&lt;/a&gt;. There are steps leading up the inside to a wooden ladder giving access to the spacious roof.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Continuing south for another few kilometres, there is a dirt track on the right leading to &lt;a href='http://www.explorecrete.com/crete-east/ayiofarango.html' target='blank'&gt;Ayiofarango&lt;/a&gt;, the Holy Gorge. The track is stony and cannot be taken too quickly due to potholes. If you see any cars parked by some trees, keep going. We stopped and walked 20 minutes from here before getting a lift back to the car from a French couple. We carried on driving down the track to the next set of parked cars. This was not the end of the track or the car park, but many cars found it was as far as they could go. Beyond here is a steep incline which on its own would not be impassable. However potholes on the incline make it very hard to get grip on the dusty surface unless you have built up some speed and have good acceleration (something my Seat Ibiza didn't have). I tried anyway but got stuck for a minute and was relieved that the car started rolling back down the hill. It's a 20 minute walk to the beach from here. Be warned, there are no shops. Nowhere to buy drinks or food. No toilets. And the beach is pebbly. Also Lonely Planet claims its 1km to the beach, actually its 2km. Apart from that the gorge in stunning, you will see caves, rock climbers, a dried out river bed, and your reward at the end if a quiet beach which only walkers or the odd boat trip can access. Along the gorge is another monastery. No wonder it is no longer functioning if you build your places of worship in such inaccessible locations!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Without much in the way of food or drink we didn't stay long. &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matala,_Crete' target='blank'&gt;Matala&lt;/a&gt; is only just up the coast, and is a popular beach-side town. It has plenty of shops, markets, and tabernas, many with great views across the bay. On the north side of the beach are a series of caves in the rock. The caves were lived in by hippies in the 1960s and now you can pay â¬2 to walk around them. Waves were breaking violently, very close to the shore line, so it is difficult to get in and out of the water but once in they make for brilliant wave jumping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back in Hersonissos for 8.20pm, we walked along the promenade to find dinner. The restaurants are very competitive and the best deal we got was 10% off the price and the first round of drinks free. We opted for the traditional Greek dishes of Gyros and moussaka. Across the road we had a post-dinner drink at Hook's bar, so named because of the seating is in the form of swinging chairs outside under the star, overlooking the coast. They offered the now standard deal of 'big beer' for â¬2.

&lt;p&gt;
Today we explored &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elounda' target='blank'&gt;Elounda&lt;/a&gt;, a seaside town to the east. It is famous for the island of Spinalonga, an abandoned leper colony to which you can get boat trips but we did not go there. We drove from Hersonissos and it took 90 minutes. We started by snorkelling and saw anemones, fish, and a lone sea urchin. We then drove over the causeway to the island of Kavousi and started walking up a hill to get a view. The walk contained impenetrable walls and gorse and we gave up 2/3rds of the way up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tired and thirst we found the Hirona pool bar and enjoyed the luxury of Cokes and the Internet. The final thing we wanted to see was the sunken city of Olous by means of snorkelling. So we drove back onto the island and walked along the coast past a church where we entered to the water. There are a lot of sea urchins here so make sure you are careful or wear footwear as I did.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back at the hotel we chilled by the pool, drank gin on the balcony and cooked pasta. The Team GB football was on TV. A 1-1 draw against Senegal, with Craig Bellamy taking the lead, but slack defending at end was two points dropped.

&lt;p&gt;
As we went for self-catering do to the bargain price of â¬169 for 7 nights, the first task was to go shopping. As a typical Southern European country, the only thing small supermarkets stock are ham, cheese, an entire aisle devoted to crisps, chocolate, and booze. The old woman was so shocked to see how much someone had actually spent in her store that we got a 5% discount card and a bunch of free bananas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We spent the morning by the hotel pool and had lunch on the balcony of our room. In the afternoon we walked to beach where we found clear, warm water in a huge bay area. We set up on some sunbeds but were then accosted for money so moved on as there was nothing saying that there were charges. We walked along the seafront, some of which was through hotels and found Star Beach. This is a free entry pool, bar, and beach area which seems to be a party Mecca for German and Dutch tourists drinking beers in the lazy river and enjoying eurodance music all afternoon. There is security on the front entrance (but not the beachside entrance) to prevent people bringing in their own food and drink for 'tax reasons'. I'm assuming this is because they don't want to pay any (it is Greece after all).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We walked back through town past pottery shops, quad bike rentals, and tabernas, and stopped off for piÃ±a coladas in a bar. For dinner we walked up the hill to the quiet village of Koutouloufari where we found Emmanuel's, a restaurant recommended in Lonely Planet for its wood-fire oven lamb, cooked with bay leaves and rosÃ© wine. It was lovely and cost â¬13. We continued to explore and the next village is Piskopiano. There is a bar we went into to have a quiet beer (Mythos), but there was Cretan dancing that night. The dancing started in a civilised fashion, but it was not long before the plates were smashed and the floor set on fire. Audience participation was encouraged and I was chosen to go a Cretan dance myself. It was a very funny evening and an essential Greek experience on a holiday here.

<description>Leaving from Birmingham Airport and arriving in Crete</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Jo booked a half day off work for a 17:45 flight from Birmingham Airport to Heraklion, Crete. On the way up we stopped at the village of Gaydon. We had a picnic in the church's graveyard, areas which are always quiet and lovely for sitting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the airport there was a dispute at security over a liquid I was trying to take through. I had inherited an empty Russian vodka bottle that was 100ml, so ideal for taking on planes. Unfortunately the bottle was in Russian so cause d a lot of confusion over what it was and how much it contained. The bottle had 0.1 followed by an unfamiliar symbol. I tried to argue that the bottle was clearly 100ml by looking at it but I was told it could not go through. After going back landside to figure this out I spotted that it was 100cm cubed. I was then able to use my iPhone conversion app to prove that this is equivalent to 100ml. But surely if your job is solely to look at liquids coming through you would gain an appreciation of units and what 100ml looks like? Tino 1 Birmingham Airport 0. The other side of security contains the all-important free drinks tasting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Turning up early at the Monarch check in meant we had unknowingly be upgraded to pseudo-first class. You don't get treated any better; you just get the nicer seats with a little bit more leg room. Flying out the UK on such a clear day with great visibility I enjoyed spotting towns and roads. I was able to work out where I was when I spotted the lake at Blenheim Palace and was soon able to recognised Oxford, and then had an amazing view of my home town of Abingdon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We arrived at Heraklion airport at midnight. I went to the Olympic car rental stand to collect the car. I was surprised to find out about their fuel policy which is annoyingly in the small print of the booking. The fuel surcharge was 90 Euro, making it very expensive fuel. Having already paid a deposit there was little to do but pay it. Top tip: Do not use Argus car hire as booking agents as they do not make all the charges clear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Seat Ibiza was reasonable but had very poor acceleration. Driving is of course on the right, but actually this really means most people straddle the middle of the kerbside line like they are a Scalextric car. The hard shoulders are frequent even on single carriageway roads. I first thought this was weird and poor driving but then realised the following day that it is to allow cars behind to overtake more safely. If only slow drivers in the UK were more considerate in letting people past when they are driving too slowly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Roads are not signed well so after leaving the main dual carriageway it was not long before we were lost in the villages. It did not help that locals had not heard of our hotel. We got sent up a ridiculously tight road to find a hotel that was not ours. Finally we got to Hersonissos, found &lt;a href='http://www.marevaapartments.com/' target='blank'&gt;Mareva Apartments&lt;/a&gt;, unpacked and had a beer at the poolside bar. We met Yiannis who was very friendly and helpful. He had a long night ahead, awaiting arrivals much later than our own. We got rave reviews from a group who were waiting for their coach transfer to the airport to go home. Shame one of them left their phone...

&lt;p&gt;
Booking a late flight back on Sunday allowed an extra day in Glasgow to see the city and its museums. I decided the best way to get around was by Subway. Glasgow has the third oldest subway system in the world (after London and Budapest). It has changed little in appearance since its creation (unlike London's underground), except for a switch from rope to electric. It just looks magnificently retro, its colour scheme, the quiet platforms, the low tunnels. Even if you can get around Glasgow more easily by bus it is still worth a trip on this transport system just for the experience itself. The system consists of one circular line running in opposite directions. They are called the inner circle and outer circle. A day pass is very cheap (only a few quid), but the subway does shut early on Sundays (6pm). If you do go, be aware that taking photographs in the station is prohibited by byelaws introduced in April 2012.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first museum we had actually visited the previous day. The &lt;a href='http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/our-museums/goma' target='blank'&gt;Gallery of Modern Art&lt;/a&gt; is in an ornate building. There is a nice mix of objects and paintings. The highlight was a video showing a series of explosions, fires, fuses, balances, and swinging in a domino effect. It  lasted over 30 minutes, so it must have been a nightmare to set up!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
West of the city on the bank of the Clyde is the &lt;a href='http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/our-museums/riverside-museum/Pages/default.aspx' target='blank'&gt;Riverside Museum&lt;/a&gt; which is a transport and travel museum. It has famous rally cars, sailing boats, trains, trams, and motorbikes. The motorbike top trumps game, using real bikes, is well worth playing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the east side of Glasgow is Barras market, a place to pick up second hand bargains, knock off watches and football shirts, and antiques. It is firmly in Celtic territory. We tried to get a free tour of the &lt;a href='http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/YourCouncil/CityChambers/guidedtours.htm' target='blank'&gt;City Chambers&lt;/a&gt; but it turned out to be shut on weekends, despite the website saying they were open every day. The tours run at 10:30 and 14:30 and you can just turn up to go on them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our final museum was the &lt;a href='http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/our-museums/kelvingrove' target='blank'&gt;Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum&lt;/a&gt; which is almost like a cathedral. It's an eclectic mix between the factual and the bizarre and is definitely a place where there is something for everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before heading home we had a dinner deal at &lt;a href='http://www.barologrill.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Barolo Grill.&lt;/a&gt; I found it on voucher website, but they were offering the same deal at the restaurant irrespective of the voucher. A bonus of the trip was a visit to the duty free at Glasgow Airport where I invested in two 1L whiskies for Â£55 (Glen Garioch Founder's Reserve and Aberfeldy 12yo).

&lt;p&gt;
A long time ago I booked flights and a hotel cheaply in preparation for the wedding of Graham Lewis and Alison Eadie. My preference for travel would have been by train (sleeper) but the prices weren't even close to being competitive. So we flew from Birmingham Airport early in the morning by Flybe. Again I would have preferred to get to the airport by train, but the shocking service on Sunday evenings and high price meant I drove. The flight wasn't very busy and was only a small plane.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Arriving at Glasgow airport we got the bus in and had breakfast at Wetherspoons, with a nice selection of Scottish specialities. Lunch was free and kindly provided by Delice de France and O2. It was such a generous offer we returned the next day for more free food. We stayed at the Etap hotel on the bank of the Clyde. It took a long time to check in as there was an almighty argument with some guest and the manager. We shared a taxi with Pagey and Louise to Pollokshiels Burgh Hall, the location of the ceremony and reception. The hall is church-like, though the ceremony was humanist. It was run by a Scotsman who was funny yet had a strong gravitas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This was followed by a champagne reception with quoits and Connect 4 while the hall was being cleared for the wedding breakfast. After the meal there was a Ceilidh which was very hard work as it was incredibly warm, and then a disco.

&lt;p&gt;
An early morning start to see the torch for a second time, this time on Oxford Road Abingdon. This is a 5 minute walk from my house and it proved to be much busier in Abingdon than in Oxford. Numbers were buoyed by the fact that parents and children were on their way to school at the time. It was so busy that we had arrived too late to get a space at the front of the crowds.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
A nice bonus was the free coffee, pain au chocolate, and bacon butty provided by a strange alliance between the local church and Budgens. A great way to start the day, especially as I only had free periods at school today!

&lt;p&gt;
Today the Olympic torch reached Oxford after starting in Luton and visiting Milton Keynes, Aylesbury, Woodstock, and Bicester. Fortunately for me it was running 20 minutes late, which made up for the 20 minutes I wasted at the bus stop. Oxford Bus Company had stopped running buses down High Street too early, so I waited for a particular bus  when I could have got any of the previous four to go past. I was not the only person who had done this. The rude drive claimed there were notices at all the bus stops (there weren't) and their twitter account seemed more interested in telling me I was wrong than offering anything resembling an apology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So now I had to walk through Christ Church College to get to Cowley Road. I was very surprised by how many people were walking in the opposite direction. Why would you not want to see the torch is it was only a 5 minute walk away from you? When I arrived at The Plain, the roundabout was packed with people in high spirits. Walking up Cowley Road I have never seen so many people packing out the pavements in Oxford.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
We found a spot outside Sainsbury's. An ideal location as it provided a decent view with not as many people as closer to town. It also was convenient for gin and beer, and was the best place from which to walk to Morrell Avenue to see the torch again. The procession was more disjointed than I expected. Every so often a group of people would walk by, then a big gap. There were samba dancers, cheerleaders, and policemen on bikes giving high 5s. Then the advertisers: Coca Cola gave out free bottles of Coke, Samsung gave out free Union Flags. Lloyds TSB gave out nothing.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Finally after a long wait the torch came by, and then it was gone. It was an emotional moment, not so much because of seeing the actual torch but more seeing how many people had made an effort to come and see it. A quick walk to Morrell Avenue offered a second view of the torch with a different runner. It was great to see so many people proud to be British and delighted to see something they will never see again. Until tomorrow.

&lt;p&gt;
As part of ACE week (alternative curriculum experience), Science ran a trip to the &lt;a href='http://www.cotswoldwildlifepark.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Cotswold Wildlife Park&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the largest zoos in the country, near Burford in West Oxfordshire. It is a great place to visit, and around 4-5 hours is about the right amount of time to spend here. The park is split into several themed areas with on the best being the Madagascan area. The first attraction here at 11am is the penguin feeding and talk. When this finishes the meerkats offer the most popular feature. Meerkats of advert fame are a lot smaller than I expected, and the baby meerkats, being particularly small took most of the awes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the back of this walled section is the lemur walk through. Here you are told to leave bags outside, particularly if they contain food. Otherwise the lemurs will go for you! The lemurs jump around you and are quite happy fighting, completely disregarding your presence. The talk is at midday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The safari area has the usual zebras, giraffes, ostriches, and lions (who were very sleepy and are getting very old). The insect area was closed for refurbishment, so the best indoor building is the reptiles. The petting zoo has pigs, but did not seem too popular.
The food is very expensive so if you do go take your own. A special mention must be given to the aardvark.

One the four previous occasions I have been to Spain, I have always spent some time brushing up on my Spanish, which is not fluent, but allows me to do at least some talking in structured situations such as restaurants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have visited Greece twice before (once to the mainland, once to Falaraki), but have never felt the need to make an effort to learn Greek. So I feel this is the year it will happen. I have borrowed a Teach yourself Greek book from the library and have been listening to the Michel Thomas series of language CDs. So far I can order a bottle of wine, an ouzo, and a water. That's one more thing than I'll need to be able to order this summer!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Physics is great because I already know a large number of Greek letters and their English equivalent, so pronunciation should be reasonable, and loads of Greek words are in English anyway so it is often easy to have a stab at what a written word means.
&lt;/p&gt;

One week in Crete booked! Despite initially wanting to go all-inclusive, we identified Crete, specifically the village of Koutouloufari, near Hersonissos, as where we wanted to go. The price of a return flight with Monarch and a self-catering apartment was much more competitive than a hotel resort nearby. Plus we'll have the freedom to enjoy the local bars and tabernas, and not worry about spending a full day exploring the surrounding region.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have taken out a few travel books from the library and so far identified quite a lot to do. There are water parks, aquariums, gorges, mountains, beaches, wineries, archaeological sites from Minoan times, and caves claiming to be the birthplace of Zeus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We are staying at the &lt;a href='http://www.marevaapartments.com/' target='blank'&gt;Mareva Apartments&lt;/a&gt;. Every review I have read so far highlights how wonderful Yannis (the owner) and his family are, so I am looking forward to this hospitality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have had to renew my passport. There is a 2-3 week turn around, so I am hoping this is not delayed or there might be problems! The remaining things to sort are car rental so that we can explore as much of area around Hersonissos and Heraklion as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>England 1-0 Ukraine</title>
<description>Five games unbeaten, England qualify for the QF as winners of Group D</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Tonight Roy Hodgson defied the odds by taking his depleted England through to the Quarter Finals of EURO 2012 as winners of Group D. Not only that but England became the first team to have five different goal scorers at the tournament. 'Strength in depth' was not a phrase that sprang to mind when the final squad was submitted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ukraine started the game in a more positive fashion and were the better team, essential as only the win was enough for them to qualify. They came close on too many occasions for comfort, but it was relieving that either they were so far out that it was signs of desperation, or that Joe Hart was having his best game of the tournament so far.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Despite the way the game was going, the best chance fell to the rejuvenated head of Wayne Rooney. A delightful cross from Ashley Young, a free header from 8 yards, and two yards wide of the post.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Given the advantage in possesion which the Ukrainians were building, it was a very sensible decision to start to play it around the back before half time. It led to the inevitable whistles from a partisan crowd but it ensured England went into the break at 0-0. Psychologically they were of course winning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the interval Rooney scored the only goal of the game. A corner was only half cleared to Steven Gerrard on the right wing. The eventual Man of the Match's delivery had been superb all night. This was no exception. Such was the pace and accuracy of the ball that it took not one but two deflections of defenders, before deflecting off the keeper's hand to the head of Rooney. One yard from goal. Not even a hair transplant from hell could prevent this one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The main talking point after this was a possible equaliser from Marko Devic. A long ball and pass found Devic clear on goal. He lifted it past Hart, but it was cleared heroically by Terry. At first what looked like a superb clearance was revealed to be a goal as it clearly crossed the line. However further replays showed Milevskiy to be clearly offside. Fair that Ukraine were denied a goal (still not made up for Germany in South Africa).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The pertinent thing was that the sixth official with a perfect view didn't give the goal! What is the point of them? Sepp Blatter: get video replays involved. NOW (but only if they would be used to show the Ukrainians were offside in the build-up too).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
News that France were losing 1-0, then 2-0 to the already eliminated Swedes boosted spirits and significantly meant England would avoid the Spaniards until at least the final. Even Shevchenko in his last hurrah could not pick up Ukraine who now needed two goals. His frustration resulted in a petty yellow card.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Awaiting England are Italy on Sunday evening. The Italians have not looked special but have done the business and looked solid in defence. Like England. This might not be one for the purists. Or it could be a classic. Fingers crossed that the Greeks put out the Germans on Friday...
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MITx 6.002x Final Exam passed</title>
<description>I have passed the Circuits and Electronics course of MITx's first online undergraduate course</description>

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of a hectic half term on a stag do one weekend and a trip to South Wales the following weekend, I had to do my MITx 6.002x final exam. Sadly I have not had enough time recently to do full justice to the very end of the course. Though I am glad to say I passed with a B grade.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did not have time to watch the final week of lectures which put me at a massive disadvantage on OpAmp questions. Also I had not been able to revise the final 5 weeks of content. This was because I was taking the final exam at the last possible moment and with no spare time in the previous two weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was extremely relieved to amass enough points to secure the pass so I kept going and through hard work got up to B. I kept trying to get more points but it became clear that it was not likely I could now get enough for an A so I stopped as I simply didn't have enough spare time to continue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I thoroughly enjoyed this course and have learnt so much about the complexity of circuits that I didn't know before. Even if I never use it again it was really interesting to find out about some of the building blocks of analog and digital circuit which have applications in radios and computing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The circuit creator was enjoyable but obviously the real practical element was missing from an online course. I am going to try to apply some of these skills, probably over the summer, and the most obvious thing to build would be a radio, something big and small boys have been making for the last 70 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Below you can see my progress chart and my certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>Using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to produce a browsable photo gallery for my blog</description>

&lt;p&gt;
I've been keen to have a photo gallery on my blog for some time now. So I searched the web and found a large range of photo galleries which I liked the look of. The first two I tried were very nice but were a complete pain to get to work and were far too rigid in how they worked. So I ditched these and finally settled on this &lt;a href='http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/07/05/minimalistic-slideshow-gallery/' target='blank'&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt; on tympanus.net. The tutorial was well explained and the code was clearly laid out so that it was easy to edit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First I set about replacing html links to images with some PHP script which searched my blog for images and wrote these links into the html. I then wanted to be able to link from the image to the relevant blog post so I added an extra button, and with a little help from JavaScript pro Jo, I got the link to work. The final step was solving the issue of the gallery not being circular when the number of images is not a multiple of 6. So I added some PHP which counts the number of images in my blog and only returns a multiple of six. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So that's where my Sunday went to, but I am really happy with the results, and I have learnt some JavaScript along the way. The front page now only has a few minor things to tidy up before it is complete, then I will need to do some improvements to the way the blog posts themselves are displayed.

<title>Sweden 2-3 England</title>
<description>Theo Walcott led comeback puts England 2nd in Group D</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Theo Walcott inspired England to their first win at Euro 2012, scoring one and setting up another in a match they were losing. Andy Carroll scored first with a powerful header off a magnificent cross by Gerrard. England looked comfortable, though not special, for the remainder of a quiet first half.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sweden's main strength was from set pieces, and it was from a free kick that they equalised. Strong determination from Ibrahimovic lead to the ball falling fortuitously to former Aston Villa defender Olaf Mellberg. Hart got his hand on the shot but couldn't prevent it going past him. Glen Johnson tried his best to clear it off the line but it was very diffcult for him and he could only play the ball sideways into the goal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moments later Sweden took the lead, again through Melberg with a header from a free kick. It was a ball England should have defended better, as Mellberg was completely unchallenged. It was not clear who exactly should have been marking him, but the Three Lions will need to be better organised against set pieces from better teams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cue Walcott's arrival. A corner was cleared by the Swedes but only as far as the Arsenal winger 20 yards out. His shot ended up at easy catching height in the centre of goal, but it was the lift and swerve that he generated which left the keeper completely unable to do anything about it. It was a quick response that took the wind out of Sweden's sails.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Into the last 10 minutes, Walcott burst in the penalty area and put in a cross to Danny Wellbeck. The ball was behind the United front man, but a combination of his quick thinking, awareness, and sublime touch enabled him to spin flick it into the net to seal a 3-2 victory. A goal to remember from a player who looks to have a very bright future. Steven Gerrard had a great chance to make it four, but his close-range volley was straight at Isaksson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Roy Hodgson can take enormous credit for a difficult victory against Sweden, the first ever in a competitive match. His decision to play Carroll was a good one. The substitution of Walcott for the ineffectual Milner won England the game. Sweden will be very disappointed to lose a game in which they played well. To lose both of their games so far from winning positions must really hurt and they become the second team to leave the tournament.
&lt;/p&gt;

Wikis are the future of education. Actually wikis are the present in education. They are incredibly simple to set up, students like using them, and they open up the possibility of students helping each other with homework. The wiki I have set up, &lt;a href='http://lwsphysics.wikispaces.com' target='blank'&gt;http://lwsphysics.wikispaces.com&lt;/a&gt;, is a private wiki, but membership can be requested. I have started setting homework exclusively on this site. The most powerful thing it has is the ability to post a discussion post on each page, therefore questions can be asked on each individual homework. I will use the wiki to keep track of who has and hasn't completed the homework. For this week's homework students will put their work and upload the relevant files onto the wiki and I will put feedback on there in the form of a comment. The main thing now will be to maintain the momentum and keep using it each week.

<title>Walk around Blaen Bran, Cwmbran</title>

&lt;p&gt;
Out of curiosity I tried the MapMyRun app on my iPhone for the first time. The app uses the GPS on the iPhone and Google Maps to track a walk. I was really pleased with automatic verbal updates it gives. Every 1.6km it announces the current distance, time per km, and time. The walk took in woodland, an abandoned reservoir, and upland heathland and moorland.
&lt;div id='blog-photo-3'&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;The new town of Cwmbran has beautiful Brecon-style hills right on its doorstep.
&lt;/div&gt;
	The panorama was taken at the highest point, but the best way to see what I did is to watch the fly through video (requires Google Earth plugin), or view the &lt;a href='http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/101342383' target='blank'&gt;MapMyRun route page&lt;/a&gt;.

A grand day out on the train, exploring the rest of South Wales. We walked to Newport station to catch a return train to Barry Island, home of Gavin and Stacy. The ticket allows you to break your journey at Cardiff, so we walked around the capital. For the second weekend in a row I picked the only sunny day to go to the beach, a masterstroke in shear luck.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/62/cardiff-sculpture.jpg' rel='lightbox[62]' title='Cardiff is a modern and vibrant city with trendy bars and modern sculptures.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/62/cardiff-sculpture-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Cardiff is a modern and vibrant city with trendy bars and modern sculptures.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Island' target='blank'&gt;Barry Island&lt;/a&gt; is not really an island, but until very recently it used to be. The construction of the Barry Docks formed a land bridge to the mainland and is connected by road and rail. The train has to approach the station very slowly due to a very tight curve off the mainline, and a steep incline onto the island itself. Alcohol is banned on the streets and there are no pubs (only a restaurant bar), which helps keep it a family location and prevents it being ruined. It is full of cheap tat shops such as Hyper Value (as mentioned in the GLC song Guns Don't Kill People, Rapper Do, 'I seen it in a documentary on BBC2, Shot to death outside Hyper Value, Guns blazin like Michael Caine in Zulu'). The beach is a wonderful expanse of clean and soft sand at low tide. Ice creams were amazing and excellent value at Â£1.60 per cone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/62/barry-island.jpg' rel='lightbox[62]' title='Barry Island's promenade is surprisingly nice, with ample free parking.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/62/barry-island-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Barry Island's promenade is surprisingly nice, with ample free parking.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is a headland, only 3 minutes from the beach with a superb view of the beach, but sadly also a view of the naff looking pleasure park. 
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/62/barry-island-headland.jpg' rel='lightbox[62]' title=''&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/62/barry-island-headland-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;The headland has steeply dipping rocks exposed at low tide, which I explored.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src='http://occipital.com/360/embed.js?pano=ZrB2vT&#38;width=100%&#38;height=480'&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is a pirate-themed crazy golf with a really good set of holes and by far the best theme a crazy golf course can have. I was pleased to be on the winning team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back on the mainland we had a drink in the Sir Samuel Romilly (an amusingingly named Wetherspoons as I am good friends with a couple who's names are Sam and Romilly) and watch the Dutch lose 1-0 to the Danish. Overall I though Barry was an excellent British seaside day out, extremely good value for money (not counting the 200 mile round trip from Abingdon), and if I was ever in the area again on a sunny day I would definitely go back.

<title>Newport, you knows it!</title>
<description>Weekend in Welsh Wales is a winner</description>

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With Friday being the last day of half term and Jo having a day booked off, we planned a lastminute.com weekend away. We opted to go to the Brecon Beacons, but rather than staying in this national park I found that Newport would be cheaper and save at least 1 hour of driving. So we booked into the Etap hotel 1km out of the city and just off the M4.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Driving down was through some of the worst rain I've ever seen on the M4. This made me really glad we went for a budget hotel, not camping! First stop was &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cwmbran' target='blank'&gt;Cwmbran&lt;/a&gt;. It's the Welsh equivalent of Milton Keynes. Its town centre was entirely planned and built in one go. It has a surprising mix of concrete, brick, glass, and stone buildings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/61/cwmbran.jpg' rel='lightbox[61]' title='Cwmbran is a new town and is a huge shopping complex in the middle of the valleys.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/61/cwmbran-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Cwmbran is a new town and is a huge shopping complex in the middle of the valleys.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It has quite a nice mix of shops. Wilkinsons, Marks &#38; Spencer, and a range of value and charity shops. Best of all is free parking in a covered multi storey car park. It was not a surprise that it was busy with shoppers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/61/caerleon-roman-museum.jpg' rel='lightbox[61]' title='Caerleon Roman Museum'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/61/caerleon-roman-museum-low.jpg' style='width:65%;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/61/roman-helmet.jpg' rel='lightbox[61]' title='Caerleon Roman Museum'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/61/roman-helmet-low.jpg' style='width:29%;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Next we stopped at the village of Caerleon, a site of a Roman fort which is now a free &lt;a href='http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/roman/' target='blank'&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt;. Only the foundations of part of the gymnaisum and the outdoor swimming pool remain but it is enclosed in a sympathetic building and is subtly lit to give the impression of the pool being full of water. The panorama below  didn't really work well in the low lighting conditions so it doesn't do justice to the atmosphere created inside. &lt;script src='http://occipital.com/360/embed.js?pano=9fz3Vg&#38;width=100%&#38;height=480'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can thoroughly recommend the &lt;a href='http://www.redlioncaerleon.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Red Lion&lt;/a&gt; next door, which provided a cheap pint of Green King IPA and main meals for under Â£3. Down a hidden alley of specialist shops we found a treasure trove of sculptures, including what clearly appeared to be the large Welsh lovespoon ever created.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/61/welsh-love-spoon.jpg' rel='lightbox[61]' title='The largest wooden love spoon in Wales?'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/61/welsh-love-spoon-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;The largest wooden love spoon in Wales?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The rest of the afternoon was spent in Newport after checking into the hotel. We walked a long way out of town to the &lt;a href='http://www.fontb.org.uk/' target='blank'&gt;transporter bridge&lt;/a&gt;, one of only two working examples left in the UK. I never actually know what a transporter bridge was until today. It turns out to be a platform suspended on cables. The platform is pulled horizontally across the river to the other side. It is free for pedestrians and a nominal Â£1 for cars. Council cuts mean the bridge will be open less frequently next year. I feel it would do a lot better if it was actually signposted from town as we only found it by knowing in advance of our trip and by using an Ordnance Survey map.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-2'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/61/transporter1.jpg' rel='lightbox[61]' title='The Newport transporter bridge towers over the docks. A hidden gem outside of the city.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/61/transporter1-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;The economy in Newport is thriving.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the way back I couldn't help but pop into Sports Direct to buy both the home and away England shirts. They were really good value and since buying them I really love the design and material of the kit. Later that evening we had a drink in the Tom Toya Lewis, one of three Wetherspoons and watched Russia annihilate the Czech Republic. We followed this with dinner at the &lt;a href='http://www.newworldcantoneserestaurant.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;New World Cantonese restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. It was lovely food and the manger was very friendly, though I wasn't too impressed with my fortune cookie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/61/fortune-cookie.jpg' rel='lightbox[61]' title='My fortune was sadly hidden within a different cookie.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/61/fortune-cookie-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<description>A new website to host my Physics podcasts</description>

&lt;p&gt;
It seemed like a good idea to have my own personal website to host my Physics podcasts on, rather than uploading them to a school specific website. This is because it protects my personal ownership of the podcasts and also helps associate the professional identity with myself rather than the school. It will also help generate a larger audience if the website is not branded with a specific school.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I registered &lt;a href='http://www.physicasts.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;http://www.physicasts.co.uk/&lt;a&gt; last night. This morning I completed the branding exercise by reserving facebook, twitter, google, and youtube accounts in the name of Physicasts. Annoyingly someone has already taken @physicasts on Twitter but they have never used it. Also Physicasts does bring up a few results on iTunes, but these are titles of individual podcasts rather than a series. Apparantly the authors claim to have made these podcasts in the 'back of our Physics lessons'. God bless the American education system. While its not a water-tight branding exercise (like Jade off of The Apprentice last week), I feel confident it won't overlap with anyone else now or in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have started work on the website as well which I am hosting myself. It still needs a few more days work on it to really get it going, but I think I've hit a programming wall this afternoon and need a break.

<title>Pagination of XML data using PHP</title>
<description>How I reduced the number of blog posts which load at once</description>

&lt;p&gt;
As this is now my 59th blog post it seemed like a good idea to restrict the number of posts which load at one. This required 'pagination', the ancient art of making pages. So I started work on this when I got up this morning. I made some PHP script which calculates the total number of relevant blogs, then how many pages it needs to spread them over. Another part of the script uses the current page number to work out which post it needs to display first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After conquering this, it was fairly straight forward to use the variables and a foreach loop to generate links to the appropriate number of pages. Initially I had tried to look for a copy and pastable solution, but actually it was easy enough to work out what I needed to do and I have improved my PHP skills as a result.

<title>Tag Cloud</title>
<description>Using PHP to create a tag cloud from my RSS feed</description>

&lt;p&gt;
This has taken quite a bit of time to make, but I am very happy to have completed a tag cloud for my blog. Not only does it look like, but it also adds essential functionality for any decent blog. It also provides a nice overview of what I have blogged about for the reader. While I have nothing against things like Blogger and Wordpress, I set myself the challenge of making and hosting this website entirely by my own means. I am really glad I did this because this has forced me to learn a bit more PHP and after this afternoon I feel I could write some code from strach rather than copy, then past, then see what happens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To make the tag cloud I coded the script to create a string consisting of tag names from my RSS feed. The code then word counts the tags placing them in an array, orders the array, then slices the top 25 tags and alphabetises them. Finally the piece de resistance is using the array to determine the font size for each tag based on how 
frequently the term is used.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have posted my code as a &lt;a href='docs/TagCloud.txt'&gt;text file&lt;/a&gt; if you want ideas on how to make your own tag cloud. I have explained why I have included each part as I am not a PHP expert and there are probably other (more concise) ways of doing this. If you have any feedback on how it is coded or have any suggestions on how else I could of coded it, I'd be grateful for a comment.

<description>Long weekend in North Devon over the Jubilee Bank Holiday</description>

Like football it seems that these days Jubilees have their own highlights programs. The images were amazing to watch, and were nicely condensed. I now also feel like I didn't miss out too much by being on a stag weekend in Westward Ho!, North Devon. The weekend was expertly organised by &lt;a href='http://sonictruths.net/' target='blank'&gt;Chris Sutton&lt;/a&gt; for the stag, Graham Lewis. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;The view from out 5 star apartment over looking Westward Ho! beach.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I managed to fit in some fantastic bodyboarding on the only properly sunny day of the trip. The beach is large, sandy, and had perfect surf. We stayed in a luxurious self-catering apartment overlooking the beach. I obviously cannot say what we did, so let just say we made jigsaws... Already looking forward to a weekend in Glasgow for the wedding in July.

I made my first innovative use of ICT post-CPD. I set a homework to my Y10 classes to listen to my podcast on the EM Spectrum. The majority of students stuck a QR code into their planner rather than write down the short URL. The reaction was quite positive, I've never seen a Y10 class actually excited by the setting of a homework before.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tomorrow I will be using 10 minutes of the science faculty meeting to pass on some top tips on using ICT. I have produced a &lt;a href='docs/ICT2012/The innovative use of ICT.pptx'&gt;handout&lt;/a&gt; for other staff to take away. I will not be doing any training at this stage. My aim is to inspire the other teachers to try at least one new thing from my sheet before the summer holidays. The ideas are a mix of webtools and software links and how they could be used in lessons (and why they should be).

&lt;p&gt;
The rest of today was personal development and reflection time. I used the time to develop my podcasting skills.  I produced a revision podcast on the Electromagnetic Spectrum for Y10. The first aspect to a podcasting lesson would be planning a script, so I got a revision guide from the National STEM Centre and started planning. What I would say. While it is possible to edit and remove mistakes from the audio I learnt that it is much easier to do the podcast all in one take and plan very carefully in advance what you will say. I find it very difficult to talk into a microphone even though I am quite comfortable speaking in front of people, so I would probably write a full script which I could just read out until I became more comfortable doing this. I used a textbook and a rough script as a prompt so remind me not to forgot anything important. I ended up with 27 different files which I had to either delete or edit in! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using Audacity to edit, I removed stray words, sections which I repeated to improve on an earlier attempt, and sections with gaps of silence. What started as 16 minutes of raw footage ended up as a neatly produced 7 minute mp3 file. I used 64kbps mono encoding which is good enough for speech. I used noise reduction to compensate for the wind that was picked up by the voice recorder. I have bought a TASCAM iM2 microphone which plugs into an iPhone and gives broadcast quality sound recording. I have make the podcast available for my Y10 students to download by creating a public dropbox folder. The link is &lt;a href='http://db.tt/9iMvsgyb' target='blank'&gt;http://db.tt/9iMvsgyb&lt;/a&gt;. Next week I will set my Y10s a homework of listening to the podcast and writing down 5 key points they learnt from it. I will also print out QR codes for the students to stick into their planners to give an easy link to the file
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I really enjoyed podcasting. I will make it a focus for next year's Performance Management and try to get everyone in the department to make at least one podcast each by the end of next academic year.

<title>Webtools and Freeware</title>
<description>Free websites and downloads that are useful in the classroom</description>

&lt;p&gt;
The following are all free downloads which could be useful in Science teaching

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.stellarium.org' target='blank'&gt;Stellarium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Stellarium is a free open source planetarium for your computer. It shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope. You can change you location, go backwards and forwards in time, and find out information about what you are looking at.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href='http://scratch.mit.edu/' target='blank'&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
A visual programming tool for kids. My school's Year 7 ICT course spends a third of the year using Scratch. In Science it could be used to make a game to revise a topic. A higher level use would be modelling (e.g. making a ball falling under gravity). This is would really make kids explore their understanding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.cabrillo.edu/%7Edbrown/tracker/' target='blank'&gt;Tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
You can upload a movie file (.avi or .mov) such as projectile motion. By advancing the video frame by frame you can click on objects. The software is quite powerful and can analyse the motion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.debugmode.com/wink/download.htm' target='blank'&gt;Wink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Wink is a screen recording tool which can make files (e.g. video tutorials). It creates three files (.html  .js  .swf), all of which need to be present to work. Recording uses the keyboard to start/stop recording. It works fine at 8fps. After it has created the project you can add text boxes onto individual frame. You can add 'next' and 'back' buttons to allow the user to control when the video advances. You can even add images or audio.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href='http://cooltoolsforschools.wikispaces.com/home' target='blank'&gt;Webtools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
We then spent 30 minutes reviewing webtool posted on the above website. There are loads!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt; &lt;a href='http://prezentit.com/' target='blank'&gt;Prezentit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Allows multiple users to collaborate on a PowerPoint and then the file can be downloaded onto you computer. (Research in groups)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt; &lt;a href='http://www.wolframalpha.com/' target='blank'&gt;Wolfram Alpha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A massively powerful computational engine - can solve any question&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt; &lt;a href='http://fuse.microsoft.com/page/kodu' target='blank'&gt;Kodu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Like Scratch but you can make games in 3D and play on your PC or Xbox (for ages 8 and up)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt; &lt;a href='http://debategraph.org/home' target='blank'&gt;Debate Graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A way of visualising debate - is it suitable for schools? I will have to test it later.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt; &lt;a href='http://paperrater.com/' target='blank'&gt;PaperRater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Perfect for proofing coursework. It will check for spelling, grammar, quality of writing, and origintality. This will vastly improve the quality of coursework in A-Level Physics from our weaker students.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

SMART whiteboards have more interactive software than PowerPoint which is very much just a presenting tool. The toolkit within the SMART notebook software has activity generators, such as keyword match, category sorting, anagrams. The software can be used to create a backbone to a sequence of lessons with files attached. PowerPoint can be used as a tool to aid taking of independent notes. By setting up a presentation with a progress bar on an automatic timer, students pulled out the key points and took their own notes. PowerPoints can be saved as pps files for running as a show. Quiz and hyperlinks can build a pseudo-webpage. Excel can be used to make student friendly graphs so that they just put in the data and the graphs are made automatically. Visual Basic macros in Excel can randomly choose students. Worksheets can include QR codes, which students could scan with their phones (e.g. to get help and check answers, or link to external websites - so many great possibilities). There is a wealth of useful apps but as protractors, distance measurers, seismometers, colour detectors. Some great ideas which will need to looking at tomorrow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The files that were demonstated are available for download below.

Mike Shaw showed how to run a blog and include hyperlinks. The aim is to use feedburner to add podcasts to an iTunes channel. This is a nice idea but I need to consider whether I want everything on my personal blog to end up on iTunes. It might be useful to do this for a blog on the Physics website. This would include posting revision podcasts as they are made which would automatically be added to the iTunes channel. I will be using the personal development time to plan out this aspect of the website and experiment with podcasting.

<title>Podcasting: Audio recording and editing</title>
<description>Making simple audio podcasts in lessons</description>

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href='http://www.boffinmedia.co.uk/about' target='blank'&gt;Richard Hollingham&lt;/a&gt; came into the NSLC to run a session on podcasting in lessons. He is a former senior producer for BBC Radio 4's today programme, but is now a freelance science journalist, writer, and broadcaster. The first thing he advocated was the simplicity of audio podcasting over video and I agree with him. He demonstrated an audio podcast made by some students. The quality was very good and they clearly enjoyed making it. They have posted their podcasts on &lt;a href='http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/schools/podcast/' target='blank'&gt;Rothamsted Radio&lt;/a&gt;. One group wrote a script for the introduction and end. Another group were reporters and asked questions. The format was Jingle, intro, report, ending, and jingle. They were recorded seperately then edited together rather than doing it in one 6 minute recording. Editing was minimal to put the sections together. Scripting a list of questions in advance helped but it was only looked at the end of the interview as a check that everything had been asked (as it is important to listen to the intervewee). Questions like how, why, when are good, but 'To what extent...' is more open ended.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I made my podcasts using VC Audio Pro (a Â£5 app for iPhone), which does not require iTunes to transfer audio over WiFi. Others on the course used a Handy Recorder H2. We recorded an &lt;a href='audio/Interview%20with%20Dr.%20Feelgood.mp3' target='blank'&gt;interview with Dr. Feelgood&lt;/a&gt; in three sections and the app as very easy to edit together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final challenge was to make a scientific podcast, recorded all in one take. We aimed it at Y7 teaching food chains but it had a slightly humorous element to it so I wouldn't actually use this in a lesson! It is 3:17 long and is entitled &lt;a href='audio/Rabbit Watch.mp3' target='blank'&gt;Rabbit Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;audio controls='controls'&gt;
  &lt;source src='audio/Interview%20with%20Dr.%20Feelgood.mp3' type='audio/mpeg' &gt;
  Your browser does not support the audio element. Download from &lt;a href='http://tinorace.co.uk/audio/Rabbit Watch.mp3' target='blank'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Video lab 1 investigated the potential for using the iPod touch in Science. We use a free app called 'Motion pictures' which I have downloaded onto my iPhone as well. It records video, allowing you to set the number of frames, how often frames are recorded, but the playback frame rate is always 30fps. I recorded 180 frames, 10 seconds apart to record two ice cubes melting (one on a metal tray, one on a plastic tray). This involved a little maths to calculate the number of frames needed to compress the event from 30 minutes down to 6 seconds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href='http://pic-collage.com/' target='blank'&gt;PicCollage&lt;/a&gt; is a nice app allowing the user to arrange, crop, and resize photos onto a collage which can be posted on Twitter or saved onto the iPhone's camera roll. Here is the &lt;a href='http://twitter.com/tinorace/status/205648399280779264/photo/1' target='blank'&gt;collage&lt;/a&gt;  I created.
 If iPods were being used in Science it would be a nice way of recording evidence of work such as during a practical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then used Stop Motion HD to make Wallace and Gromit style animations. We explained how ice melts on plastic and metal surfaces. It took 30 minutes to make 17 seconds of footage. I then recorded audio over the video and published it on my &lt;a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch&#63;v=wXGbDMJMI0U' target='blank'&gt;youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. There is even a &lt;a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch&#63;v=iWZltcsC7CU' target='blank'&gt;making of&lt;/a&gt; to be included in the DVD extras! Other groups also used plasticene modelling as well as drawing on a board with marker pens. We kept the iPhone still by using a retort stand and remote shutter (the earphone's volume control takes a still image each time it is pressed). Now we just need a class set of ipods...
&lt;/p&gt;

<description>Disseminating gap tasks, GPS data capture, and personal development time</description>

The following is a summary of all of the gap tasks that members of the ICT Innovations 2012 Course have done since February.
&lt;h3&gt;Gail: STEM website and training&lt;/h3&gt;
Gail has been working on a STEM Club web for her school. She also went on a course to help her provide external INSET. She trained other teachers to use &lt;a href='http://www.picturetrail.com/' target='blank'&gt;Picture trail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/' target='blank'&gt;Picasa&lt;/a&gt;, and most impressively &lt;a href='http://prezi.com/' target='blank'&gt;Prezi&lt;/a&gt; which is a zoomable PowerPoint with great potential for mindmapping.

&lt;h3&gt;Cathal: Chemistry wiki&lt;/h3&gt;
Cathal's wiki used code from &lt;a href='http://www.widgetbox.com/' target='blank'&gt;Widget box&lt;/a&gt;. He also used picture trail to make a nice rotating box as a starter activity. The wiki was for KS5 as he thought that Y10s didn't have the maturing for this level of independence. He created a page for each student, and used the pages to communicate with students and parents. Assignments were uploaded, and answers where uploaded later. His students have started supporting each other on the forum (a built in widget on the wiki). A help page allowed students to instantly feedback which sections of an assignment they needed help with after Easter.

&lt;h3&gt;Alan: VLE&lt;/h3&gt;
Alan set up a page on his school's VLE (Moodle). Students used &lt;a href='http://phet.colorado.edu/' target='blank'&gt;phET&lt;/a&gt; to get data, make spreadsheets to do analysis and then upload the assignment onto the VLE. He shared the success criteria for a project via the VLE. He set up a revision forum for Y10 students where students can ask questions. Traffic lighting was done in a spreadsheet. This was very nice as it was done by entering one letter, but colour coded the list and allowed them to filter out the green statements. He bought goosenecks and webcams to create pseudo-visualisers. They cost Â£20 each to make and his department currently has two. He has agreed funding for Word Wall after demonstrating to the heads of various departments and is getting someone from the company in to demonstrate it.

&lt;h3&gt;Nicky: WikiSpace&lt;/h3&gt;
Nicky's presentation used Prezi and was very impressive. She has worked on her VLE but at her school both teachers and students struggled using the VLE. She started with a wiki. Her school has invested in online homeworks. Her classes have used &lt;a href='http://www.glogster.com/' target='blank'&gt;glogs&lt;/a&gt; (an online poster creator), Prezi, &lt;a href='http://www.xtranormal.com/' target='blank'&gt;Xtranormal&lt;/a&gt; (storytelling), and used WordWall. However she mainly worked on &lt;a href='http://www.wikispaces.com/
' target='blank'&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Y11 students' wikis were very successful. Y9 enjoyed it but probably didn't learn as much. Nicky recorded video in two free periods to make a Y6 taster activity - something Lord Williams's could do for Flippy the Fish (a similar Y6 day).

&lt;h3&gt;Peter: AS Wiki, Datalogging, Word Wall&lt;/h3&gt;
Peter's department has purchased some new datalogging equipment, which is now tied into practicals in their schemes of work. He has convinced other departments in his school to supply money for Word Wall (citing PSHE as a good example of liking this and providing money) but is having problems sourcing the remaining money from the school itself! He did some modelling of half life using a popcorn maker (great idea!) and has a lovely selection of practical ideas on his &lt;a href='http://ictinnovations2012.wikispaces.com/Peter+Grzeszczyk%E2%80%99s+page' target='blank'&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; on the course wiki. His own wiki page set students the task of posting a resource that helped them understand a particular section of the topic. The wiki is protected so that only his students can access this which is a sensible thing to do for my wiki.

&lt;h3&gt;Zed: Imaging&lt;/h3&gt;
Zed (an ICT technician) used timelapse feature using free software he downloaded to photograph a Magic tree growing crystals. The software added a date/time stamp. He then put these photos into a video. He showed science teachers at his school how to use the software and they plan to film seeds growing. Students have created podcasts (audio and video book reviews)
. He is planning to get students to set up a website and upload the podcasts each week. He is also doing a project with feeder schools
, working on podcasts and showing others how to use this technology.

&lt;h3&gt;Mine: Webcams and Website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a href='docs/ICT2012/Innovations in ICT 2012.pptx'&gt;My presentation&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Katie: Word Wall, imaging, storyboarding&lt;/h3&gt;
Her school had Word Wall already, so she started using it. It was easy to put students into groups. She got her students to make a quiz which was then used in another class. She used visualisers to do basic imaging (such as looking at the side of a match box in a Friction lesson). She pushed for interactive workbooks (&lt;a href='http://www.goscienceonlineassessment.co.uk/' target='blank'&gt;Go Science&lt;/a&gt;) to be made available for students to use in school and at home. Her classes made interactive storyboards, including one where students looked at how to stop Global Warming. She found that the students had more confidence doing this instead of having to act it out.

&lt;h3&gt;Christine: many fingers in many pies&lt;/h3&gt;
The presentation again made lovely use of Prezi. She dug out and dusted off some dataloggin equipment and used it sucessfully in Chemistry lessons, but it only works on 1 laptop! She liked the TTS digital microscopes but bought their visualiser instead. Her A-level students used &lt;a href='http://photobucket.com/' target='blank'&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt;. She enjoyed blogging, and recommended &lt;a href='https://www.yola.com/' target='blank'&gt;Yola&lt;/a&gt;. Her students have all had to make websites. Her Y10s had to teach a revision lesson, and put their revision resources onto the wiki. She also used &lt;a href='http://pbworks.com/' target='blank'&gt;PBWorks&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative wiki site. She will be using Labbooks exclusively with a class next year as she has acquired some laptops. A project she is working on is a KS4-5 transition science network. A university student was given the task of developing their Physics website. Also she has done a project with NTU using inkpads. Christine has bought some HueHD webcams, used &lt;a href='https://www.openetherpad.org/' target='blank'&gt;Etherpads&lt;/a&gt;, Prezi, Xtranormal (resulting in tremendous explanations), and &lt;a href='http://corkboard.me/' target='blank'&gt;CorkboardMe&lt;/a&gt;.


&lt;h3&gt;Jack: Webcams, Google drive, Datalogging &lt;/h3&gt;
His school has several HueHD webcams, so he trained people in his depertment to use them. He also takes photos on his phone and puts them into dropbox to display on the projector. He created an interactive resource for KS5 Physics using GoogleDrive. He can see which files have been downloaded and how frequently so he can monitor revision. He has some DataHarvest sensors on order but had problems using previous sensors due to a network upgrade to Win7, so he has not been able to instill confidence using this yet, but will do with the new equipment. He showed pictures of his use of visualisers (exploring concepts such as solids, liquids, gases, and orbits of Earth/Moon).

I have arrived at the &lt;a href='https://www.sciencelearningcentres.org.uk/' target='blank'&gt;National Science Learning Centre&lt;/a&gt; for Residential Period 2 (RP2). The drive up was plesant and it is a beautiful sunny day both in Abingdon when I set off and York when I arrived. The first task after lunch will be to share and review the gap task, so here's the &lt;a href='docs/ICT2012/Innovations in ICT 2012.pptx'&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the powerpoint I will be using. I will have to speak for 10 minutes about what I did in the classroom since RP1 and how it has impacted my teaching and that of others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AFter this we will be doing GPS datacapture, creating videos, podcasting, and looking at webtools and freeware. The course finishes on Friday after which I will be going to Lancashire to see my parents for the weekend.

&lt;p&gt;
The Lord Williams's &lt;a href='http://lwsphysics.shorturl.com' target='blank'&gt;Physics website&lt;/a&gt; is now completed in terms of design. Most of the time recently was spent on making the drop down menu work. Content-wise all of the past papers are available for download, just in time for Y13 to go on study leave. The coursework section is also mostly complete. I will need to add in some revision resources for each chapter of the course. From June when Y12 return I will start posting homework details on here and the students will start working on the wiki.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This just leaves me with two days to make lots more use of Word Wall and get some more feedback from students. I will be driving to the &lt;a href='https://www.sciencelearningcentres.org.uk/' target='blank'&gt;National Science Learning Centre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://www.visityork.org/' target='blank'&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday morning and will be there for Residential Period 2 from Wednesday to Friday.

&lt;p&gt;
I have completed 90% of the eCPD for the Innovations in ICT course as of Wednesday with one week to go to Residential Period 2. I have successful used a webcam in lessons with 3 different classes, I have created some more Word Wall activities but now need to use them in lessons and get feedback on them, and the Physics website in pretty much complete in terms of content. I spent most of this afternoon making the powerpoint for the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jobs to do before next week include: Use word wall in more lessons, improve the layout and design of the Physics website, get one more person in the department to use the webcam and let me know how it went, then make final changes to the summary powerpoint.

&lt;p&gt;
The day after Blackburn Rovers were relegated from the Premier League after 11 years, &lt;a href='http://www.sportingintelligence.com/' target='_blank'&gt;Sporting Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; have leaked a letter sent by Paul Hunt, the deputy CEO of the club. Deputy CEO, yet the club has no Chief Operating Officer. The letter was allegedy sent after the Bolton game which saw the biggest protests against Kean and was the no going back point in his relationship with the fans. Not a single point of his ten point plan has been actioned and that is why the club is in a financial mess and got relegated. The link to this was placed on the &lt;a href='http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/' target='_blank'&gt;Lancashire Telegraph's&lt;/a&gt;
 Rovers forum but was removed by the Venky's Evening Telegraph under the continual threat of being shut down by &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Anderson_(football_agent)' target='_blank'&gt;Jermone Anderson's&lt;/a&gt;
 who has blocked all free speech on his dispicable role at the club. Below is the full letter (which I can only assume is genuine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wednesday 21st December 2011 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Paul Hunt &lt;/br&gt;
Deputy CEO &lt;/br&gt;
Blackburn Rovers &lt;/br&gt;
Ewood Park &lt;/br&gt;
Blackburn &lt;/br&gt;
Lancashire &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Madam, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have been your senior officer at the club for 6 months now and I feel that I must now write to you to ask you to make some significant changes to save the club, perhaps from relegation but also perhaps from administration. 
In twenty years of the Premier League there has been only one side that was bottom of the league at Christmas that has survived relegation at the end of the season. With the bank closing in, I fear that they will look to foreclose and have the potential to implement financial restrictions upon the club that could (as a worst-case scenario) enforce administration. 
I have kept quiet for a time now out of utmost respect and I trust that you realise that I am only emailing you now as I want what is only the best for Blackburn Rovers and the owners. I am very much of the opinion that we can save the club and I have always been very supportive and positive towards the owners. Therefore I hope you know that what I am saying is considered, honest, constructive and from the heart. 
I ask that we instigate all the changes below in this 10 point plan. If we do, then I guarantee that, come the summer, the club will be in a much stronger position than it is now. This will give the owners the following benefits: 
A richer asset in the club as a whole 
A happy, strong and valuable playing squad 
Peace of mind that it is being run admirably 
Protection for the Venky's brand and the BRFC brand 
The full backing of the Premier League 
Deliver the community a club to be proud of 
A devoted team of staff 

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. Promotion to CEO &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
I am aware that that when we met in April, we said we would look at this within the first year. I believe now is the right time to promote me to CEO. The Deputy title is confusing to staff, supporters and media. I am confident that I now have the knowledge to be able to deliver strong progress. We have a great club, good team and an excellent range of staff that I feel can take this club forward, given the right support from the owners. Naturally, with extra responsibility I would like extra salary and I would be happy with a relatively modest increase with the promise of a good bonus and increase in salary in the summer that would reflect the improvement in position. I am currently the lowest paid senior club official in the Premier League. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. Owners to invest in the club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
As you are aware Barclays have asked for the owners to put Â£10 million into the business. This needs to happen and I am confident that this could only be a loan as we would increase the value of the club significantly. With all the speculation in the press the playing staff value and overall club value is depreciating on a daily basis. By putting an end to this the owners would be protecting their investment, putting their trust in the executive team and the club. The position with the finances is a cause for grave concern. Auditors KPMG have put as many obstacles as they can in the way of signing off the accounts due to their concerns. We continue to try and work with Barclays but they are very quickly losing patience as we cannot give answers. We have been forced to agree to additional spending against our wishes (Christmas hampers, sponsoring the Princes Trust event etc) and I am fearful that the situation will only get worse. 
During January we need additional funding to pay wages etc. Scottish club Hearts did not pay their players in November and have effectively breached their contracts. By law (supported by FIFA) the players can now annul their contracts, seek other clubs and still chase the club for payment of their wages. Clearly, the club will not receive any fee for any transfers. See link &lt;a href='http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/2011/12/10/hearts-stars-told-they-can-walk-away-from-club-now-over-unpaid-wages-86908-23623969/' target='_blank'&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/2011/12/10/hearts-stars-told-they-can-walk-away-from-club-now-over-unpaid-wages-86908-23623969/&lt;/a&gt; You may also be aware that HMRC (tax  
authorities) have been chasing Portsmouth Football Club for a debt they owe. HMRC have made a technical mistake in law and  
therefore cannot claim the money they are owed. They will make sure of course that the next football club that falls out of  
line, won't be so lucky. We need to make sure that this club is not Blackburn Rovers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Manager to change and report to the CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
 
Publicly I have been asked to support the manager and I always have as I personally like Steve. I have supported him from the  start and have been desperate for him to do well. However, I am now of the opinion that it isn't working and he is ready to  
go. He has lost the crowd and as a result of this evening's game has lost the dressing room as well, the players no longer  
want to play for him. It is a shame and disappointing but we must act now to save the club. The board should be asked their  
opinion in who should be the new manager. The board has over 60 years football experience between them, it would be a  
travesty not to rely on that experience for the biggest decision the club will make this season. The new manager should now  
report into the board who then recommend and endorse his wishes to the owners. Allow the board to protect the owners from the 
media, supporters etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4. Trust the executive, bring us in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Give the executive team at Ewood Park, the latitude and authority to run the club. Everything at the club needs to come  
through either myself, Simon Hunt or Karen Silk, both Karen and Simon are excellent appointments. We have vast experience  
and with Vineeth as well, I am sure we have a winning team. The owners must learn to trust us. I am enjoying working with  
Vineeth and although he has little experience in football, he is quickly learning. I am trying to establish him with all the  
other staff too and am introducing him to the Heads of Department on an ongoing basis. I don'	t really think for one minute 
that the owners will allow this club to go into ruin but without knowing this for 
sure, we need to be prudent. However, if we had more information on your plans, strategy and thoughts going forward (after  
assisting you in formulating that strategy of course) then we can support and deliver growth. Without knowing the plan, we  
will of course be guarded and suspicious. With our fiduciary responsibilities as directors, if the club goes under, the  
directors (including Vineeth, Mahesh and Gandhi Babu) are all potentially personally liable for that failing and the courts  
could take our houses from us. My family do not deserve this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5. PR just from Ewood &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Another big issue is the PR and the fact that a lot of it in the past has come from India, without our knowledge. ALL press  
statements need to come from Ewood Park with me as the spokesman. That way we can control all the output and protect the  
owners. I will take on an experienced PR consultant who will advise the board and owners. It will be someone who will be  
aware when any negative stories are about to hit the press. We must now remove the club from being headline news for the  
wrong reasons. A full PR strategy needs to be instigated from January 1st that re-engages the owners with the supporters,  
the owners need to trust us in this regard as we know our customers. As owners you are not protected. Use the board (and  
manager combined) as a buffer zone to the media, the bank, the fans and we will protect you. I want to tell the media that  
what they are printing is not true but the truth is that I do not know. It is clearly evident that neither yourself, Bala or  
Venky currently feel comfortable coming to Ewood Park. If we as an executive team had more say, day to day running and  
authority, we would be able to support you and take all the criticism ourselves. The damaging story in the Mail on Sunday has 
caused players, staff and the supporters much concern. We need to invest time in stopping leaks leaving the club. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6. Regular visits to India &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
To be able to understand the strategy and to assist the owners, the executive team of myself, Simon Hunt and Karen Silk must  
visit India once every two months as a minimum. This way we can be together on all issues and help to craft them with our  
experience. I am happy for the new manager to be a part of that delegation and would welcome his input. I am very concerned  
that I have not met with you properly during the six months I have worked at the club. You have asked me to deal with things  
locally but to be able to do this, as I have asked before, I need a greater understanding of your aspirations so I can  
deliver on them. If you keep me informed and learn to trust me, I can be your mouthpiece. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7. Regular visits to Blackburn and Premier League games &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
The owners must attend games in Blackburn as often as possible and I would suggest that at least one of the owners is present for at least a quarter of the games. The staff needs to meet you and get to know you too, whenever I have met the owners, I feel warm and strong and you instil in me the fight to face challenges and win. The supporters also need to meet you and we need to get the message of solidarity out there as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8. Hire and Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
The executive team at Blackburn Rovers must be allowed to hire and fire staff. We will of course ask for the owner's opinion  
for senior positions but we must be allowed the latitude in this. In Simon Williams we have someone who is against the owners and spreads the word wherever he can. I am disappointed I was not allowed to remove him from post in the summer, when he and the rest of the staff were expecting it. We must act soon in this regard and look to review other positions and then give the staff great morale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;9. Lost revenue and brand equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
We are losing fans and customers at an alarming rate. I am very concerned that fans are voting with their feet and not  
attending, not purchasing and not engaging with the club. Research shows that only 5 percent of ex season ticket holders will  ever return. We are losing sponsors and suppliers. I am concerned we will lose Umbro if we continue to manufacture Rovers  
shirts in India for the RoverStar programme. Their contract specifically disallows this and we are putting at risk 800k  
pounds of annual revenue. The Blackburn Rovers and Venky's brands are both suffering terribly. Whilst there are negative  
goings on such as protests, complaints, media stories, unhappy fans etc, then both brands are losing brand equity and  
consequently, losing value. I am also concerned that the Premier League will intervene soon as they may take the view that  
their brand is being tarnished by association too. It is all reparable of course but we must start to act now by building  
bridges with fans and the media as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10. Support is necessary, Final thoughts &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
I am disappointed that we have not managed to progress as I would have liked over the past 6 months. I for one was very excited to be given the opportunity and wanted to assist the owners in delivering strong progress for the club. However, we have been too busy fire fighting (protests, media intrusion, finance issues) to do this so far. As you know, I like to be proactive but the current climate only allows us to be reactive. 
I feel impotent as I am not asked by yourselves about my opinion on matters. I joined the club to make a difference, not to sit by and simply action instructions. I appreciate that my advice will not always be acted upon but I am disappointed that I am not asked. I have a great deal to contribute and have great experience. I won't get it right every time but will always do my best and learn from any mistakes. 
My concern is for the staff. They have put up with a lot recently and are still supportive. They live in the community and are being asked questions by their friends and family but cannot answer them. They are also being challenged at the games and when they come into contact with fans. Most are junior or part time staff who are feeling under pressure. I am concerned that they are going to become too stressed and will look to get jobs elsewhere. We have some great staff and cannot afford to lose them. 
I may be speaking out of turn here, but I am also concerned that no one reports everything to you, that is, everyone tries to report positive news and are not overly forthcoming when negative news needs to be told. By not having the full details, anyone would find it difficult to make decisions that encompass all the facts, all of the time. I am sure that if you were exposed to the full story, no matter how negative sometimes, that you would do the right thing. I need to be able to report a little more readily to you and on an infinitely more regular basis. 
Please don't view this as me questioning the owners unjustly. Please be reassured that I do question things, it means I am doing things right for the club and the owners by not accepting things lightly. This is how I work and how I must continue to work to get the best for Blackburn Rovers. With my experience of Blackburn now and my previous experience at three other prominent clubs, I do feel as though my suggestions come from a position of strength and can make a huge difference to life at Blackburn Rovers. 
I would very much appreciate an opportunity to speak with you on these points by invitation to India. Without instigating these points it will get more and more difficult to deliver progress for the club. I call on the owners to act, to play their part in the investment that puts all our minds at rest, and then allows me and the executive team to initiate all of the above points for the greater good of Blackburn Rovers. 
I look forward to hearing your thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With very best wishes for a bright future, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul

In a couple of hours I have knocked together a growing bench for the conservatory. The motivation for this was to have somewhere to put propagators and give more space to grow plant indoors. The lower shelf will keep seeds, tools, and books. I bought some timber (44 x 44mm) and chipboard (12mm) from B&#38;Q yesterday before the football, cut the pieces when I got home, then screwed them together this morning. It needs painting, most likely in sweet pea which is a light pink that has been used in the garden. That will have to come another weekend though as it is miserable today. The wind has brought down a few branches, damaged several plants, and blown over the plastic tomato greenhouse (fortunately no tomatoes in yet or they'd be dead).

<title>Why Chris Wilder should go</title>
<description>While still mathematically possible, Oxford's season is over in disappointing fashion</description>
<link>http://www.tinorace.co.uk/blog.php?no=43</link>

<month>04</month>
<date>2842012</date>
<content>
&lt;p&gt;
I've not blogged about Oxford for a few games now. I guess it's because the results (and performances) were just to depressing. Just 3 points out of the last 6 matches is a pathetic return. Even if the unthinable happened, Oxford would neither deserve nor have the form to go up through the playoffs. Once again no team has particularly out played us. But the lack of power and strength up front has been even more obvious in the last month. Too many loan signings. Too many weak, skillful players, inexperienced forwards. Not enough Akinfenwa-style fatboys who can bully and use their sheer weight to force the ball in the back of the net. Also we don't cheat enough. It's the way the game is going and we're always on the end of the bad decisions, so it's time we started cheating and being unpopular in the league. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me the only step forward now is Wilder out. He's taken the club as far as he can. It's all well and good saying that he's improved us year on year, but how many strikers has he brought to the club who can't score goals? Too many! How long has his 4-3-3 system caused us to dominate games yet not score enough goals against teams who park the bus? Too long. Where is plan B to be seen when we go 0-2 down to Southend or Hereford nick a flukey goal? No where to be seen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Newcastle were heavily critisied when they sacked Chris Hughton due to the fantastic job he had done at the club in his time there. However Mike Ashley realised that past form doesn't mean you can indefinitely keep improving. He realised that someone with more experience of managing in the top flight was needed. Does anyone in the universe still think Chris Hughton should be Newcastle manager and not Alan Pardew? A similar situation at Ewood Park when Venky's realised Sam Allardyce could never lift Rovers above mid-table. Unfortunately they replaced him with a worse manager, for whom 19th place will be a good achievement because at least he moved us up from 20th earlier in the season.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So Oxford: get in someone who has league two silverware experience, someone who will bring in the fat goal-scoring centre forwards, someone who can instill a 90 minute mantality in the good core of players we have, and most importantly gamble some cash to build a decent squad so we don't have to rely on uninterested loan players when the inevitable injuries start mid-season. And most importantly, no hard feelings and a big big thank you to Chris Wilder for what he has achieved in his time here.

<title>Mid-term exam complete: scored 93% A</title>
<description>Really really happy to get such a high score, when I thought it would be very hard</description>

&lt;p&gt;
I guess I am really grateful that the mid-term was not as hard as I was expecting. Scoring 93% now means I am pretty much guaranteed to pass the course so now the pressure is off and it might help me exceed just a pass. I started the test as soon as I got home from work on Friday, expecting that i would need the following morning as well to complete it. However after just a couple of hours I had completed all the questions, probably taking the longest over two minor parts which I initially got wrong. I was certain I had tried the only other two possiblities for each one but just got the red cross on all 3 attempts. So a little bit disappointed to drop the 7% on what looked like easy questions, but also delighted to get 93% after difficult homeworks and mid-term practice questions. Wine in the fridge, will celebrate tonight! I can see it on my CV already... Cambridge, Oxford, MIT... where next Harvard? Yale?

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
1) Word Wall
&lt;/h3&gt;
Word Wall in installed in all of the classrooms I teach in. I have used Word Wall to create seating plans for my Y7 classes. I've created a starter and a plenary (both definition matching exercises)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Question for Word Wall: Can I use the swapper function to sit together m/f pairs?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Use the seating plan to randomly choose people to answer questions.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Use the full range of activity types with a Y7 class.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Get another member of the faculty to create an activity and use it in a lesson (and get feedback).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Get feedback from another teacher, a TA, and students about the use of Word Wall with a Year 7 class.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Demo Word Wall in a faculty meeting at the end of the year once my trial is complete (after RP2).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
2) Physics Website
&lt;/h3&gt;
The Physics website is hosted. There is a sensible URL redirect set up. The relevant documents which students will want to download are hosted. I have done a questionnaire with my two classes to find out what they would want from a website (this pretty much tallied with what I already suspected). I have done some exam analysis on past paper questions and fed this into the website's database. I have used the query function to bring up a list of past questions suitable for revising a particular topic and used these to target revision in a lesson.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Link all documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Sort out the navigation menu bar
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Complete exam analysis of paper papers and add to database.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Get feedback from students on use of wiki at end of the year.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Start setting up accounts and the home page of the wiki in preparation for Y12 post-exam lessons (after RP2)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
3) Webcam
&lt;/h3&gt;
I have had a webcam installed in my lab at lower school. I have found out which other departments use this sort of technology (English - visualisers)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Contact English and ask for a list of ways in which they use their visualisers.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Use the webcam at least once during a demo.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Mark a piece of homework, some an example on the webcam, and get students to improve work based on what they've seen.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Get feedback from students and staff on the use of the webcam in my lessons.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Another batch of wine</title>

&lt;p&gt;
I decided today would be set aside to tidying the brewery, cleaning equipment, and starting new brews. The brewery has been a bit of a mess since I brought new stuff back home which I had been given by my Dad. Now its looking really smart after a heavy session of disinfecting and sorting. It's actually the best its ever looked (and I'm tempted to paint the walls one day to brighten it up). I've started four new lots of wine (Elderberry, Black Cherry, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc). I added some more sugar to the Autumn Blush Cider to fortify it. I started making a Bitter kit as well (one of Young's cheaper &#156;5 kits.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the rest of the day I finished painting the picnic table on the patio which looks brand new. The alpine garden has stones on it (but will need another 8 bags to finish it off. I missed United blowing the title against Everton, but watched City relegate Wolves.)

<description>Altered my action plan so that the eCPD is achieveable by the 23rd May</description>

&lt;p&gt;
I have decided to alter my &lt;a href='http://tinorace.myftp.org/Tino/docs/ICT2012/Action Plan.doc'&gt;old action plan&lt;/a&gt; as I will not be able to achieve what I originally said I would. This is because of time and other pressures on my sixth form teaching. I will still try a wiki after the exam period as I am conviced this is a great idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href='http://tinorace.myftp.org/Tino/docs/ICT2012/Action Plan NEW.doc'&gt;new action plan&lt;/a&gt;
is summarised as follows:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Trial the use of Word Wall with KS3 classes. Get feedback on its impact (from students and observers)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Complete &lt;a href='http://lwsphysics.shorturl.com'&gt;A-level Physics website&lt;/a&gt;. Use feedback from students to improve it for next year and get ideas for how to proceed with KS4 and KS3 websites which I will be in charge of next year.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Start using a webcam with various classes to improve experience during demos, and show marked work. Get evidence of how a student's piece of work has improved as a result of the use of a webcam.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

With wine's its always a long wait, but one month after starting I have 24 bottles of fruit wine (Blackberry, Peach, Strawberry, Elderflower). So far I have tried the strawberry and blackberry and both taste really nice. I am particuarly proud of the labels I have made and the bottles look fantastic on the new wine rack in the brewery.

<description>Weeks 5,6,7: Getting ahead before the mid term</description>

&lt;p&gt;
Over the last week I have spent a lot of time working on 6.002x, working through three week's worths of course material in the space of 1 week. My motivation was to get ahead on the material rather than completing homeworks the day or two before to give me a little breathing space for when I go back to work next week. Also there is a mid-term exam at the end of April and I want to give myself a couple of weeks to revise for it and try more example questions as I am still not 100% confident on being able to solve all the various types of problems without the hints given on the discussion boards. Through a combination of luck, skill, perseverance, and blatantly fully worked solutions on the discussion boards I am still running on 100% on both homeworks and labs up to the end of Week 6 (which will be the content of the midterm), and only one question left to complete on Week 7.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-align:center;font-style:italic;'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/37/mitx-progress.jpg' rel='lightbox[37]' title='Bar chart showing my progress in MIT's 6.002x Circuits and Electronics course. Note all the 100%s!'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/37/mitx-progress-low.jpg' style='width:100%;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Bar chart showing my progress in MIT's 6.002x Circuits and Electronics course. Note all the 100%s!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In summary: Week 5 looked at the MOSFET, introduced originally as a simple switch dependent on the gate to source voltage, but now seen as working as an amplifier over certain input voltages. This used both large and small signal analysis techniques which confused me a little and I will need to revisit in revision. Week 6 introduced the capacitor which I found a little easier than Week 5 but the homeworks were still difficult. Week 7 looked at the inductor and the reason for signal delay in circuits - its because most components actually act as capacitors. The week 7 homework was really easy, perhaps intentionally as its just before the mid-term?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As the season draws to the close, and after several games of outplaying opposition, particuarly at the Kassam, without picking up 3 points, the pressure and nerves are obvious, both in the players and the fans. The performance today was not spectacular, and fewer clear cut chances were generated than usual. Those that were were either criminally wasted, or resulted a goal line clearance. A 0-0 draw is a worse result for Gillingham than the U's as it keeps them 4 points off 7th with only 3 games to go. At full time is was looking like a poor result, but news that Crewe had only drawn 2-2 at relegation strugglers Macclesfield meant Oxford remain in the play-offs tonight. Two of the last three are away (Plymouth and Port Vale), seperated by a home fixture against Southend (currently 5th and potential play-off final opponents if the league remains unchanged). If we get 7 points out of those we deserve to get promoted, if we don't we deserve to fail to even make the play-offs. The end of the game was marred by another shocking refereeing decision. The ref had done extremely well up until that point, but with minutes to go Oli Johnson was through on goal with a chance at a shot. Why would he dive, it was a certain goal? He was tackled from behind, the defender got nothing of the ball and the ref blew the whistle: yellow card for simulation. Bottled it, sorry ref but you are once again out of your depth in lowly League Two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; On Sunday, Ashley Young dived for the second match in a row to win a second penalty in a row. Oxford cannot appeal Johnson's booking even if TV evidence proved he was fouled. The FA will not penalise Young for being a diving cheat retrospectively. Where is the consistency? Where is the justice. Fans are turning off football as they realise that most results these days are decided by whom the referee likes more and which team has the most balls to take a dive or dive in for a tackle they shouldn't if they think they can get away it.

The second week of my Easter holiday was shown as 5 days of continuous rain so forgive me for not planning anything. As it turned out, every sing day between Tuesday and Friday was gorgeous and sunny. So I took advantage of this and blitzed the garden. The main focus of my efforts was digging up the lawn around the pond to provide a neater edge and make it easier to mow. There is now a tidy border which I have planted with some bulbs and will plant with some colourful ground cover in the near future. The removal of turf extended beyond the pond and was covered in weed suppresent. Next month when money is a little less tight we will cover it wil gravel and create an alpine garden. I did further tidying by digging in the pond liner, covering the edge with more sandstone slabs, and tidying the outdoor electrical cables supplying energy for the pond lights and the shed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;The west-facing allotment, with four potato trenches, and a greenhouse and tomato house newly positioned.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The asparagi plants arrived on Thursday so we now have 13 of these bare rooted plants in raised beds in the allotment area. On the opposite side of the allotment I dug four trenches in which I planted 20 seed potatoes. Other plants added included two tayberries and another gooseberry to add more barrier between the alpine and allotment areas, loads of summer-flowering bulbs in random places, and a couple of honeysuckles to climb up the arbour.

Typical of Oxford of late. Conceded an early goal. Conceded a late goal. Dominated the game for the majority of the middle part. Missed a whole range of chances. The main plus points were the emphatic header from Christiam Montano from a brillant Damien Batt cross, and a goal scored directly from a corner by Adam Chapman. He has really made an impact on the team since returning from Newport and he may be crucial to getting into the playoffs.

Going away for a week and being behind on the content meant just 48 hours to complete week 4's lectures, homeworks, and labs. I spent most of Saturday and some of Sunday to get this done. So it turns out that the MOSFET is not just a simple switch but actually has three distinct behaviours depending on the input voltage. When working in the 'saturation' region the MOSFET behaves an an amplifier (also inverting the signal).
&lt;/p&gt;

Sixfields is a strange place; like the Kassam, only there are more chain restaurants and fast food places. And the stadium is in a massive hollow. As usual Oxford filled the home team's ground for them with a strong away following. I spent a good deal of time in the pub before the games witing for kick-off. Its a strange pub as it was half filled with families eating dinner and half filled with football fans. And it took an age to get served.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;Sixfields on a Friday night. The oddest location for a stadium I have ever seen, it is in a bowl in the middle of a retail park.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oxford were by far the better team for 70 minutes of the match. The reason for defeat was a lack of concentration in the 1st and 91st minutes of the game. These two goals were seperated by a Christian Montano strike after a sustained period of pressure from the yellows. A penalty soon after was missed by Adam Chapman(only the 3rd of the season compared to the huge number given against us by referees who clearly have a grudge against Oxford for being a big club in a small league). United can take credit from an excellent performance. The evening was soured by a nasty altercation caused by Luke Guttridge who should have been sent off for retaliation on Liam Davis. This is the only time I have ever heard a football crowd chant the specific details of an incident towards the referee. Another League 2 ref out of his depth sadly.

&lt;p&gt;
Last full day! Had a long lie in necessitated by miserably cold wind and complete tiredness. I cooked a full English but this was complicated by wind blowing out the cooker flames and a lack of gas. It was cooked but it was eaten cold, which was disappointing. We spend the whole day at Woolacombe, it's bay being the best place for surfing in North Devon. As it was very cold I didn't fancy surfing, but took my wetsuit along anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is a rather pricey pitch and putt and within the first two holes I had lost my ball. There was a &#156;1 charge is it was not found which was a bit steep given the actual worth of the balls so I didn't pay it, though still managed to get a ball of the guy at the kiosk. After buying some wetsuit gloves I decided that if we were going to come all this way we might as well use the bodyboard. Sharing one between two would be alright in warm water, but standing around doing nothing when the waves weren't that good got a bit cold. Even so I managed to catch a few good waves and really enjoyed it, especially with the new gloves. Priority number 1 when getting home will be buying a 2nd bodyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the evening I had finally secured the mayorship of the local Wetherspoons so there was really only one option, Curry Club - delicious and nutritious (the last bit might be a lie). Our final stop was The Reform Inn. It's a reasonable walk from the main town centre but well worth it. There is a microbrewery on site and so a great selection of ales. The locals were really friendly and we played some of them at pool. The landlady offered to give us a tour of the brewery the following day but sadly we were leaving in the morning. If you are ever in Barnstaple you simply must go to the Reform Inn.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold and wet. Really cold. Just glad we haven't seen any of the snow down here or we'd be in for trouble. Today was earmarked as an indoor day from the start of the week due to the forecast. Just cereal for breakfast due to lack of enthusiasm for outdoor cooking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove 2 miles south of Bideford along the A39 to two stops in close proximity. The first was Atlantic Village outlet centre. I bought Yorkshire pudding tins (how did we not already have these?), cake tin, Nike cycling gloves (decently sewn together by the good children of the Phillipines), two pairs of gloves from M&#38;S (for &#156;5 and &#156;1), and a heap of chocolate from Cadbury's. This was a good outlet experience&#59; not busy, not too many shops, not ridiculously expensive (why would I want expensive things if I'm cheap enough to go to an outlet store, eh? Yes I'm talking to you Bicester village)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the afternoon was at 'The Big Sheep' 1km back up the road. This is a family, sheep-themed attraction. In no particular order we did: beer tasting (on-site brewery called The Country Life), sheep racing, lazer shooting (loved sniping unsuspecting children from a hidden fort), swan shaped pedaloes called swanaloes (which I decided was a better name than pedoswans), pedal go-karts, sheep displays, lamb feeding, stroking tiny sheepdog puppies just a couple of weeks old, and kicking footballs at targets.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;The Big Sheep had a wide range of activities, including learning about sheep and sheep racing.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A two for one with VoucherCloud brought it down to Â£6 each and coupled with Â£2 a pint we were onto a winner. Sadly I had wet and sandy socks due to the rule about no shoes on the jumping pillows and it being surrounded by a metre of sand and me leaving my shoes on the other side of the aforementioned sand. The giant vertical slide made up for this though. Every time I go on one of these it scares the hell out of me as I start to accelerate at 9.81m&#47;s&#47;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried booking for a restaurant near Woolecombe but it was booked up since they didn't have enough food. So we cycled away from Barnstaple for a change. On the way to Broughton, 2 miles down the road was the Tarka Inn but now the Broughton Inn. It's a Vintage Inn and was typically full but only had 2 waitresses. Disappointed when 2 pints of Tribute arrived with at least 1 cm of beer missing at the top (sent back for top up). Ordered the fish pie but it was sold out (though how exactly the next table managed to order one an hour later I don't know - bad waitress = small tip). Instead I had beef and ale pie with mash (delicious, especially with loads of horseradish). The cheeseboard for dessert was standard in quality but HUGE in quantity, even shared between two. I washed it down with a pint of Dutchman (9/10), a gorgeous orange-flavoured ale; light and perfect for dessert. Good food, would go to a Vintage Inn again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day of mixed weather. It started with a full English cooked on the stove (yummy). We drove to Ilfracombe along the new Barnstaple road and parked on a free street close to the centre. First we walked around the town. It's basically just one street of shops high up on the hill. Then down towards the cliffs we saw views of the sea and the theatre which is a lovely building seemingly designed to resemble a lime kiln (there are many of theses around North Devon as the soil is apparently quite acidic and the CaO is required for crops to grow well). To the side of this fantastic building is a commemorative mosaic to the world record triple jump set by Jonathan Edwards at a stunning 18.29m . I decided I would have my own attempt at this discipline. I paced back as far as I could. I waited for the toddlers to stop wasting my time. I ran. I took three jumps... 6.18m. Pathetic. I knew I was doing something wrong. A closer look and I saw that just alternating feet was not all there was to it. After realising the technique was much harder I decided the Edwards was a superhuman freak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-2'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/29/triple-jump.jpg' rel='lightbox[29]' title='Local hero Jonathan Edwards's world record triple jump is commemorated in Ilfracombe. It's impossible to not have a go at the record yourself when you find it.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/29/triple-jump-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Local hero Jonathan Edwards's world record triple jump is commemorated in Ilfracombe. It's impossible to not have a go at the record yourself when you find it.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we sat in Runnymede gardens to have a snack. Having run out of snacks we hit Lidl to buy more. They do a very nice Mr. Choc range recreating such classics as Twix, Snickers, and Mars at only 25p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sunbathe of the holiday was at the Tunnel Beaches. These tunnels were built by the Victorians as a way to create access to the beaches at the bottom of the cliffs. Otherwise this seaside town would have no beach! There are four consecutive tunnels in total. They lead to two beaches: originally a gentlemen's and a ladies beach (fortunately 'mixed bathing' is now permitted).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-2'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/29/tunnel-beaches-entrance.jpg' rel='lightbox[29]' title='The entrance to the tunnel beaches is cold and dark, but the end are secluded sandy beaches, with plenty of rock pools and other areas to explore.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/29/tunnel-beaches-entrance-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;The entrance to the tunnel beaches is cold and dark, but the end are secluded sandy beaches, with plenty of rock pools and other areas to explore.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also there is a tidal pool which is filled with fresh water twice a day. A brief period of Sun and a sheltered spot allowed a moment of tanning which I can only assume was admired by the general public. Walking around the rock pools was very cold and windy. Even colder was a quick swim in the tidal pool just before the waves came crashing over the pool edge. Glad for my wetsuit!
&lt;script src='http://occipital.com/360/embed.js?pano=8PQBJf&#38;width=100%&#38;height=480'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p style='text-align:center;font-style:italic;'&gt;
On one side are tall cliffs which needed to be tunnelled through, on the other is the Atlantic Ocean.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the satnav still in epic fail mode I relied on google maps to guide me. Obviously a mistake. Most of the route was single track, in one point it was a 25% gradient, and it wiggled everywhere. I'm not even sure is some bits were a road. This took us the the Valley of the Rocks, but it decided to be the wettest and windiest in the last 6 months so we admired the view from the car. Another mile and we were parked in Lynton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynton and Lynmouth shared a symbiotic relationship, sustained by an umbilical cord like cliff railway. Before this railway the two were basically screwed. In Lynmouth we learnt about the flood of 1952, bought some miniature baskets (5 for a Â£1), visited a free model railway exhibition, had a pint of Exmoor ale, and failed to buy a starfish as the miserable  shopkeeper had shut at 4.30. Drove back to Barnstaple the sensible way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/29/lynton-lynmouth-cliff-railway.jpg' rel='lightbox[29]' title='The cliff railway between Lynmouth and Lynton. Much quicker than walking!'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/29/lynton-lynmouth-cliff-railway-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;The cliff railway between Lynmouth and Lynton. Much quicker than walking!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried to go to Zena's restaurant again. Still shut. So a pint in one Wetherspoon followed by a steak and beer in the other one rounded off the day. The chips in spoons are much improved. Incidentally whilst watching the Barca highlights in the news, did anyone else notice how hardly anyone behind the goal was celebrating Messi's 2nd? It was just tourists taking photographs. Sad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rovers vs United. The chance of a double... Going so well... Until the last 10 mins. Typical. We had more shots than them in the first half. They played poorly. Their first goal was a cross that was so rubbish it went in the net. 0-2. I thought Rovers played well but needed more up front towards the end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saddest thing was that in a pub (The Rising Sun) in Barnstaple, there were at least 15 United fans. Why are they poring their money into a city in the north west of England that they've probably never been too? Why don't they support Exeter (League 1) or Plymouth (struggling in League 2)? Because they're rubbish? And why is this? Because the people of Devon (and other provincial areas without large cities) continue to bankroll the Big Four and pump money out of their own economy. Sad and pathetic. Only slightly sadder than the way City have thrown away this season's title and gifted it to a distinctly average looking United who couldn't even make an impact in the lowly FA, League, or Europa Cups. Worse still wins for Bolton, Wigan, and QPR see Rovers drop back into the drop zone. Damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnstaple to Bideford. Separated by 9 miles, these two North Devon market towns once had a scenic railway running between them. Now they have a scenic cycle path&#58; the Tarka Trail. This is an exceptionally well surfaced track running along the rout of the old railway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width='66%' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/DmL0F--cv5w' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started by driving the bikes to near Barnstaple station finding the nearest free parking possible. The old line runs along where the car park is so it weaves in and out a little at first. The first stop was Fremington which has a cycle hire and a cafe. We just had a walk around here with a great view over the bay. After this we stopped a couple of times at the waypoints which matched an audio trail you can download of the trail's website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-align:center;font-style:italic;'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/27/tarka-trail.jpg' rel='lightbox[27]' title=''&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/27/tarka-trail-low.jpg' style='width:65%;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/27/lime-kiln.jpg' rel='lightbox[27]' title=''&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/27/lime-kiln-low.jpg' style='width:29%;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;The Tarka Trail follows the tidal rivers of Taw and Torridge. Dotted along the trail are sites of scientific and historical interest, such as the lime kilns long since abandoned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next village was Instow where I remember traffic needing to be stopped for the James May production and where the Hornby track was laid down within the gaps of the original rails.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-2'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/27/instow-signal-box.jpg' rel='lightbox[27]' title='The village of Instow still has a signal box and some of the original track. The beach has tall sand dunes with great views.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/27/instow-signal-box-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;The village of Instow still has a signal box and some of the original track. The beach has tall sand dunes with great views.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then on to Bideford. Here there is the old station and signal box. Except they demolished all this so the track and signal box actually had to be restored in the 1990s! There are a couple of carriages at the old station, inside which are a cafe (scones and a coffee) and a museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked around town. I found a jumper in a charity shop I liked. We found a duck that thought he was a real person. Apparently he worked for the same charity shop. We had lunch and then we cycled back to Barnstaple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt from today that Chinese oven ready meals work perfectly fine in a pan on a stove, and cycling 28 miles in a day is very tiring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Felt like death this morning. Actual death. Packing up the tent was painful. Dealing with the still dodgy satnav still a nightmare. 2 hour drive to Barnstaple not the best cure. Stopped off in Yeovil on the way to eat some sandwiches, grab a coffee from Caff&#130; Nero and look around town since I've not been before. Yeovil is basically two streets running parallel from the top of a hill to the bottom. I think I was expecting more from it. I did check out the M&#38;S sale again and found some jeans I needed due to forgetting to pack any. They were Â£22 down from Â£45 which was decent but they rang up on the till at Â£12. Bargain&#58;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On from Yeovil along the A361 North Devon link road to Barnstaple where we are staying for the next 5 nights at the Tarka Holiday Park. We moved from the pitch we were given as the turf had set rock hard, due to the dry spell we're having, into the shape of the tractor tyres which had massacred the surface. They've made a great deal of there pitches practically unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/26/camp-site.jpg' rel='lightbox[26]' title='We were the only residents in a tent. Too early in the season? Or did other people know something we didn't?'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/26/camp-site-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;We were the only residents in a tent. Too early in the season? Or did other people know something we didn't?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycled into Barnstaple along the Tarka trail &#40;a disused railway which is now a superb cycleway through much of North Devon&#41; for dinner in town. Walked around looking at the highlights&#58; the Pannier market, the castle mound with drunk teenagers wishing me a happy Easter before shouting to her female friend 'I'm going for a piss. Don't follow me or I'll have sex with you'. Classy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;Barnstaple sits on the River Taw and has retained its charm and character.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the two Wetherspoons: The Panniers where I had a disappointing trio of thirds; then The Water Gate where I had a Scottish beer made from peated barley (7&#47;10);. A couple of foursquare check ins with the ultimate goal of mayorship and 20&#37; off the food bill before the end of the holiday. Dinner at Prezzo using a taste card where we shared a prosciutto and pear starter and a mixed bread board, followed by a calzone and beef ravioli. I nearly exploded but managed to fortunately keep my dignity. It is getting colder so the 3km cycle back was a bit on the nippy side. Definitely time for an early night. Shame about the lack of April Fool's Day opportunities. Fortunately Newcastle provided one by beating Liverpool. The scousers' season gets funnier and funnier&#33;

&lt;p&gt;I do not like being awoken by church bells at 7am. Just as a 5am call to prayer from a mosque would be completely unacceptable, a bell ringing on the hour ever hour in the night is unnecessary. Grrr... We breakfasted at the campsite&#58; toast with jam and a bacon sandwich and it was cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove into Salisbury and found the closest free parking to the city centre, a good 15 mins walk away. We did the shops and I got a few items from the M&#38;S sale. Then off to Wetherspoons for a Coffee Porter &#40;8&#47;10&#41; and to change into wedding ware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceremony was at the Salisbury registration office which is a lovely ornate building next to a beautiful park.

	The ceremony was done well except for when the registrar said &#39;the wedding of David and Caroline, sorry, Lucy&#39;&#33; The bride looked extremely happy during the vows. Photos and confetti were done in the park. There was plenty of time to kill before the reception so we went back to a charity shop to buy a wine rack, then got stuck in traffic on the way to Tesco. The satnav is playing up at the moment and made things difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-2'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/25/salisbury-register-office.jpg' rel='lightbox[25]' title='The register office is a beautiful building inside and out. Lucy and David signed the register after the vows were said.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/25/salisbury-register-office-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;The register office is a beautiful building inside and out. Lucy and David signed the register after the vows were said.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the campsite from whence we walked the 1.8 miles to Down Farm where the reception was. It was a right mission&#33; We took emergency wine but it was unnecessary as there were 4 different legs of beer and cider from the local Sixpenny brewery &#40;only 2 of which I tried&#41; and a selection of Madeira and port. Plus finest Havana cigars&#33; The speeches were excellent and were followed by a delicious hog roast. There were four different cakes so I had to try them all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-align:center;font-style:italic;'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/25/reception-hog-roast.jpg' rel='lightbox[25]' title='The hog roast was popular and there was plenty for seconds (and thirds, fourths...). The hat shaped cakes were stunning and as they were different flavours they all needed tasting.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/25/reception-hog-roast-low.jpg' style='width:62%;'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A massive box of Lego was quite entertaining and I specialised in building random thing mostly which spun around. The coolest thing was a museum of all the things which have been found on the farm but I only had 2 mins as our lift was leaving. A massive preference to walking 30 mins in the dark. We took our wedding favours of a bay tree, marjoram, and a few other plants. Finishing at the campsite bar was a huge mistake...&lt;/p&gt;

This evening we drove down to Sixpenny Handley to camp for 2 nights. We have come for Lucy and David's wedding which is in Salibury tomorrow. The campsite is surprisingly good, with an onsite restaurant and bar. We explored the village (took less than 5 minutes) then went to the local pub for a game of darts.

&lt;p&gt;
It was getting a bit sketchy as to whether I'd finish the week 3 assignments before the deadline of Friday. I worked for most of last night watching two lectures sequences, doing 87% of the homework and reading the lab task. It was a mammoth task although I got distracted towards the end by Domino's and red wine. The pressure was placed on me by myself due to a lack of doing anything earlier in the week and needing to pack for our Easter camping holiday which starts Friday night. Luckily I had an epithany this afternoon and worked out how to complete the lab in just a few minutes. I then completed the final two questions involving currents through diodes in 5-10 minutes by using node analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sequences this week showed how to build a digital gate using a MOSFET switch, which apparently have been in use for the last 40 years and current chips contain billions of these switches. Basically stick two in series and you've got a NAND gate, put two in parallel and you make a NOR gate. From these usefull building blocks you can use an inverter to make practically any logic gate you want it seems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also included was an introduction to non-linear elements and a range of tools you can use to solve analysis problems. I think my favourite is good ol' trial and error! I also think that the graphical method of looking at where two lines intersect has a certain beauty to it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This week I have felt a lot more confident in solving the problems set and have a better understanding of the content. Next week I will have another deadline to help sharpen my focus, as we will not get back from Devon until Friday, then I'll be going to Northampton to watch Oxford that evening. Looks like I will have a busy Easter Saturday and Sunday, unless I can squeeze in two lecture videos tonight by packing the car as quickly as possible.

&lt;p&gt;
Today started by geting up early (8am in old money) to watch the Malaysian GP. A red flag situation after only 9 laps due to heavy rain caused a half hour delay so I gave up on the F1 and headed to Oxford to buy things for the garden. As promised we went to Maidenhead Aquatics to buy pond plants. We chose a selection of oxygenators, irises, a water lily, and a few grasses. The trip also gave us some inspiration for what to plant around the pond as they have a fantastic garden at the back. There are now 13 plants in the pond but it will take a month or two before they start to fill out space and add height. I have piled up some rocks in the corner to help access for frogs, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-1'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/22/pond-plants.jpg' rel='lightbox[22]' title='Plants added around my pond in mid March 2012.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/22/pond-plants-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Plants added around my pond in mid March 2012.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Behind the pond I planted a tree fern which has been in a pot for the last 6 months, and repotted other tree ferns and ferns by the stream at the back. Jo built some pretty sturdy net cloches which will stop the pigeons eating our stuff. The front is also starting to take shape - I finished the rest of the raised beds and started filling them in with soil. There are some bulbs and flowers in the bed, but there still loads to do out front.

<description>Day out in Cheltenham, watching the football and looking around town</description>

&lt;p&gt;
A day out in Cheltenham&#58; primarily watching Oxford. Jo and I arrived early in the morning and parked up in a free parking area only 10 minutes walk from the centre. We found a place for breakfast which did a Â£1.50 breakfast special. Cheap food seems to be a bit of a theme in Cheltenham as we found many completing places trying to undercut each other. The best was a 99p cafe where every item, whether a sandwich or a burger was 99p!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-2'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/21/cheltenham-in-bloom.jpg' rel='lightbox[21]' title='Ironic, as Cheltenham as clearly not in bloom.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/21/cheltenham-in-bloom-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/21/cotswold-kebab.jpg' rel='lightbox[21]' title='A shop name with two completely incongruous words&#58; Cotswold and Kebab.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/21/cotswold-kebab-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;On the left, an ironic sign. On the right a shop name with two completely incongruous words&#58; Cotswold and Kebab.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The M&#38;S sale provided a great opportunity to spend my credit note and I got some nice tops. There's a decent range of shops including a lovely shopping centre with palms and a stream. The town centre is smart and pleasant to walk through. Oxford's shopping area has a lot to learn from this sort of place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before the football there was time to review both of the town's Wetherspoons. The first was the Bank House where I had a Norweigan bitter (6&#47;10) brewed specials for 'Spoons. It was good but probably not the best choice for a hot day. The second was the Moon Under Water. Here I tried Fanny's Bramble (blackberry cider) 10&#47;10 and Weston's twist (ginger still cider) 9&#47;10, enjoyed in the most picturesque beer garden I've ever been in overlooking Sandford Park. Entertainment was a set of Football Managers Top Trumps (a quality set full of interesting stats). At 2.30 I set off for the Waddon Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-2'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/21/whaddon-road-outside.jpg' rel='lightbox[21]' title='Whaddon Road (or the Abbey Business Stadium for sponsorship reasons) was a sea of yellow and blue, with a strong away contingent.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/21/whaddon-road-outside-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/21/whaddon-road-inside.jpg' rel='lightbox[21]' title='Whaddon Road (or the Abbey Business Stadium for sponsorship reasons) was a sea of yellow and blue, with a strong away contingent.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/21/whaddon-road-inside-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;Whaddon Road (or the Abbey Business Stadium for sponsorship reasons) was a sea of yellow and blue, with a strong away contingent.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script src='http://occipital.com/360/embed.js?pano=Qnxs6s&#38;width=100%&#38;height=480'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-align:center;font-style:italic;'&gt;Oxford fans filled just under a third of the stadium, well in advance of kick off.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Abbey Business Stadium is a lot small than I thought it would be, it was packed an the attendance was only 4,300. Oxford brought a superb following and sang in good voice. Cheltenham dominated the opening stages coming close to scoring on a few occasions. The U's finally found their rhythmn and controlled possession before half time. Moments before the interval Oxford were denied a blatant penalty as Dean Morgan was tackled from behind in the box. The referee had a clear view but waved play-on. Shocking decision.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second half required good concentration and defending as Cheltenham pressed, hoping to pick up their first win in 5 games. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, the result being a reasonable point for the yellows and a poor point for Cheltenham. Only 1 point in 15 has seen them fall from the automatic promotion places down to 6th. Oxford are unbeaten in 7, but are in danger of being caught by the impressive form of Crewe and Gillingham if they draw too many more games. Next up  is the rearranged visit to Accrington on Tuesday night. Each game gets bigger and bigger.

<title>The start of summer?</title>

<content>&lt;p&gt;It feel like the start of summer. In my south-faceing upstairs lab, with the blinds shut, all windows open and wearing a t-shirt, it was boiling. This inspired me to pay a visit to the garden centre, but I decided the tomato plants were still too small. I mean, why buy now when you can get the centre to do the donkey work and make them bigger first. They did have a great deal on a chimnea which now sits proudly in the fernery at the end of the garden. I spend some time weeding there this afternoon and discovered that it is particularly popular with midges given its shady, riverside location (more evidence of summer?) Perhaps this weekend will be the one for buying pond plants - pics to come if I do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm hoping there'll be more of this stunning weather to come next weekend when Jo and I head off first to Wiltshire for the wedding of Lucy and David, thence to North Devon for a week of camping. Tomorrow we're off to Cheltenham to watch the mighty yellows.&lt;/p&gt;

<content>&lt;p&gt;I watched the Manchester City - Chelsea game this evening. 0-1 down, City came back through a penalty for hand ball (debatable though I personally think it was the right decision as he did not need to raise his hands - simple as) and a great piece of skill which even after 3 replays it was difficult to see where the ball was and how it had been played. This all keeps the title race exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the table QPR reversed Liverpool's 2-0 lead to win 3-2 in the last few minutes. Disappointing for Rovers as we could have stayed 6 points clear. Still, with QPR's horrific run-in you still feel (and hope) they will return to the Championship.

<title>Circuit analysis and the digital abstraction</title>
<description>Week 2 of 6.002x</description>

<content>Week 2 of the MIT 6.002x course featured some new methods for analysing circuits, ones which make the whole business a great deal easier (if they are relevant to the problem). The other lecture sequence was about digital logic. A lot of the stuff on logic gates I already knew from general knowledge and even some electronics from Year 9 which I'd forgotten about. The digital logic is easy so far, but the circuit analysis can be tricky if it is not clear how to approach a problem. As is typical with university learning, you leave the lectures thinking 'I get it, this is easy', but once presented with a problem 'oh... erm???' There needs to be a clearer intermediatary step between the two. On the plus side, through perseverence I achieved another set of full marks on the week 2 lab and homework. I will need to get ahead for the next couple of weeks' lecture sequences before the Easter holidays.</content>

<title>ICT Innovations: mid-March Update</title>
<description>I have made mixed progress in my eCPD tasks so far</description>

&lt;p&gt;
So far I have had mixed success towards completing my &lt;a href='http://ictinnovations2012.wikispaces.com/ECPD+tasks'&gt;ECPD Tasks&lt;/a&gt; for the ICT Innovations 2012 course.

&lt;h4&gt;Successes:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The &lt;a href='http://tinorace.myftp.org/Tino/docs/ICT2012/Action Plan.doc'&gt;action Plan&lt;/a&gt; has been completed!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href='http://http://wordwallweb.com/'&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; has been successfully installed in both my labs and my tutor room and I plan to use it over the next few weeks.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Roadblocks:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I have asked for a webcam for my lab, which my Head of Faculty agreed to straight away, but as it is March nothing can be purchased. Ridiculous. Only in the public sector can such a daft situation be tolerated. Imagine if Tesco couldn't buy any more stock in March as it was approaching financial year end!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I have contacted our network people and asked abouth any issues with making a website. Apparantly the school is getting a new website next month, with areas for each subject. I've put the Physics website on hold until I'm more clear on the timeline for this as I don't want to waste time doing something that would be replaced soon.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I am not sure when I might be able to start using a wiki with my A-level classes. Both year groups are in the middle of coursework, we are very tight for time with teaching the course, and I am being observed very soon with one of these groups. I am wondering whether I should abandon the idea of the wiki until June and start with the Y12s after their exam. This will be after Residential Period 2, so I will need to find something else to do before then.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

<content>Blackburn Rovers face a uphill struggle to retain the services of Steve Kean after a comprehensive win over Sunderland (2-0). Kean has guided Rovers to a yet another victory, bringing our current winning streak to two - a personal best for Kean and our longest winning streak for 18 months. Goals scored by Hoilett, who's price tag continues to rise as he enters the last 3 months of his contract, and Yakubu moved the Blue and White army 6 points clear of the relegation zone. Kean's odds of winning Euro 2012 have shortened to 5/2. Hoilett was quoted after match: 'I will celebrate with a bucket of chicken and a new contract.'</content>

<content>Another 3pts tonight for Oxford courtesy of a well-taken strike from loanee Dean Morgan. The goal was the result of a sustained period of superb play and a great team move. This came after a quite but hard-fought 1st half, and was followed by 20 minutes if solid defense. Jack Midson received a warm reception on his return but had a very quiet game as he was watched closed by Michael Dubbery and Jake Wright. Not spectacular, not exciting, but a solid and much needed win. This was all the more important as Crewe maintain the pressure, whilst Gillingham dropped off the pace losing to Crawley. The most surprising element of the League Two promotion race has been Cheltenham's poor run in form, gaining only 1 point out of 15 and losing the last four on the bounce. The U's visit Whaddon Road on Saturday hoping to inflict five defeats in five, and a win would take the yellows above Cheltenham into 6th. No pressure then for a massive local derby!</content>

<content>The main task I had planned to finish today was setting up a database which allows for students to search the Physics website by chapter, topic, and exam year. It is able to return which exam papers, and most importantly, which questions on each paper are relevant for a particular topic. The results also give a link to download each exam paper and its mark scheme. Now it's just a simple case of doing some exams analysis and finish recording which topic and chapter each question relates to.</content>

<content>I got bored of waiting for the turf I dug up to rot down over the course of the next year, so I sorted it out and made a second large area usuable for growing vegetables. This is ideal because this week I accidentally bought too many seed potatoes. They're second earlies, which in addition to the first earlies means we should be kept in potatoes for many months and so avoid a repeat of the Irish potato famine, which we remember ever year on St. Patrick's Day.</content>

<content>I drove to Woking yesterday to stay with Graham Le Page. He showed me all the highlights of Woking including O'Neills, Wetherspoons, Jaipur curry house, and his flat which is really nice and overlooks the canal (wish I'd brought my kayak, next time). In fairness Woking has one of the most interesting Wetherspoons I've ever visit, with a pretty cool robot thing, and a mechanical clock on the ceiling for which you can make time pass really quickly by pressing a discrete switch on the wall. I think it's even cooler because they don't make a big thing of it and it's a hidden secret. I thought I was lost when I arrived at Graham's house, then I realised it must have been a couple of years since I last came to visit and I hadn't actually been to this flat before. We're about to head into town to get some food and have a look at the shops, then it's the rugby, England vs France. There doesn't seem to be much good football on TV today (Norwich vs Wigan doesn't count as good football).</content>

It's trimmed down of content and is now clearer to read without having to scroll horizontally (the devil's work) or zoom in (another pain in the backside). For the benefit of massive geeks I have used JavaScript to detect the screen resolution and different CSS style sheets to display the content differently. I would like make versions for tablets and widescreen TVs too. If only I had an iPad3... If anyone has a spare iPad3 that they would like to donate to me please sent it to the usual address.</content>

<title>MITx 6.002x - Circuits and Electronics</title>
<description>I have started a new undergraduate course on MIT's prototype online learning system, MITx</description>
<link>http://www.tinorace.co.uk/blog.php?no=8</link>

<content>&lt;p&gt;This week saw the start of MIT's online learning initiative, called &lt;a href='http://mitx.mit.edu/' target='_blank'&gt;MITx&lt;/a&gt;. The prototype course is &lt;a href='http://6002x.mitx.mit.edu/' target='_blank'&gt;6.002x Circuits and Electronics&lt;/a&gt;, and is an online version of their regular course 6.002. The course aims to bridge the gap between A-level Physics and understanding how electronic systems are built, stopping someway short of how computers are built. I have been very impressed with the course so far. It has been comprised of online video lectures by Professor Anant Agarwal, video tutorials, an interactive virtual circuit maker, and questions which self mark. There is also a textbook and the reading of this is optional. The relevant parts are online (a blessing given that its Â£55 on Amazon!) The online system is very easy to use, and if anything I think it is much easier to learn this way than by actually attending lectures.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I have completed week 1's lectures and tutorials well in advance of next Friday's deadline. The course is assessed as follows: 15% homework (computer marked questions), 15% labs (computer-marked virtual circuit building), 30% mid-term exam, 40% final exam. Solutions for the homeworks and labs are not available online but you are allowed to replace answers if you make mistakes. So far I got 100% on the homework and 100% on the lab (after a couple of minor corrections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On completing the course I hope to be awarded an electronic MITx certificate, anything less than an A grade would be a disappointment. The course and certificate will be free on this course, but future ones will require a payment for the certificate. My main motivation for doing the course was to see how the style of tuition worked and so far I am really enjoying it. I imagine I will do other courses as long as the cost of the certificate is not crazy money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to watch some football :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<content>&lt;p&gt;The first stage in my ICT Innovations project is creating a website for the school's Physics department. The layout is loosely based on this website. I am slowly adding content, but will need to find out what students will want the website to include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the website is hosted at &lt;a href='http://tinorace.myftp.org/Physics' target='_blank'&gt;http://tinorace.myftp.org/Physics&lt;/a&gt; and will have a temporary URL 
setup in the next few days at &lt;a href='http://lwsphysics.shorturl.com' target='_blank'&gt;http://lwsphysics.shorturl.com&lt;/a&gt;. I have included a wiki as a frame for use by students, the address is &lt;a href='http://lwsphysics.wikispaces.com' target='_blank'&gt;http://lwsphysics.wikispaces.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

	This morning I've been working hard on new brewing projects. Currently fermenting are four wines (blackberry, elderflower, peach, strawberry). I have kegged a raspberry wheat beer (Millstone's kit) which will be ideal for early summer, and started fermenting a Continental Pilsner lager (Munton's kit) which will be bottled and chilled - perfect for a hot summer's day.
&lt;/p&gt;

	What a brilliant day! The U's completed their first double over Swindon since 1973. We only needed 10 men and 2 decent attacks to register 2 goals. A clean sheet, the first at home for what seems like an eternity, was helped by some woeful finishing by a team who are supposed to be top of the league, fully committed defending, and a never say-die attitude from all the players in yellow. If we can keep this desire to win and continue to defend this well, promotion must be well within sight.

<description>3 days at the National Science Learning Centre</description>

<content>&lt;p&gt;This week I have been off school for 3 days on a CPD course entitled 'Innovations in ICT'. I went to the National Science Learning Centre, York, where I picked up some great ideas which I will be trialling between now and the summer holidays. Using a webcam as a cheap visualiser to show marked work, and to project demos and example work, looks like the simplest thing that could have a real benefit in the classroom. I have been given a free single-user licence copy of &lt;a href='http://http://wordwallweb.com/'&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt;. This is an activity maker which can easily make games such as crosswords, anagrams, wordsearches, etc in just a few seconds. I will start using this at KS3 and demonstrate this at some point in a meeting later this year. The final good idea which I will use is setting up a wiki for students to use. I see this working really well as a revision resource which children create and edit themselves. I will trial this with my sixth form classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to write an action plan for my reseach project and enter this for the Rolls Royce Science Prize. I will post the plan here when it is written as well as the findings of the project and any top tips I pick up. The follow up will be another 3 days at the NSLC in May. There is a &lt;a href='http://ictinnovations2012.wikispaces.com/'&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; for this project too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script src='http://occipital.com/360/embed.js?pano=L4CcKT&#38;width=66%&#38;height=480; text-align: center;'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='text-align:center;font-style:italic;'&gt;This is the first panorama I ever made using Occipital's 360 app for the iPhone. This is the greenhouse on the 3rd floor of the NSLC.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having arrived in York early on the Monday, I visited York city centre. First I walked around the shops and saw York Castle Mound, with the adjacent Crown Court complementing it nicely. I also went past York Minster which I have been to before and have climbed to the top of to get a splendid view across the city.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;Yorkminster towers above everything in the vicinity. It is a wonder how such a huge building got built such a long time ago.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Having arrived in York early on the Monday, I visited York city centre. First I went to the National Railway Museum at the back of York Station which is a very impressive place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id='blog-photo-3'&gt;
&lt;a href='img/blog/3/nrm1.jpg' rel='lightbox[3]' title='The National Railway Museum has an impressive collection of engines.'&gt;&lt;img src='img/blog/3/nrm1-low.jpg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<content>After a lot of time searching the internet I have found a simple way to maintain my blog, using a php include method. Owning a &lt;a href='http://www.synology.com/' target=_'blank'&gt;Synology Diskstation&lt;/a&gt; which is capable of supporting both a htmlserver and php server has been ideal for helping me get this website up and running.</content>

	This evening I went to the Kassam Stadium to watch Oxford United vs Barnet. Ryan Clarke was the hero as his penalty save won the U's three vital points in the promotion race in League Two. The yellows are now 5 points clear of Port Vale who have a game in hand.
&lt;/p&gt;
