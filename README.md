Php is used to dynamically generate html with the advantage that bulk changes can be made to each page by only editing code once. Also when content is created, only the text for each blog post is required to be entered on the new page, avoiding having to repeat the header, css, etc.

Php is also used to return sets of blog posts based on date, category, tag, etc and to generate navigatable pages of content. Good examples of php used can be found in the 'includes' folder

The Javascript calendar was orginal from a downloaded calender plugin which has been edited by myself for style and functionality. Other Javascript code (for example for determining screen size and therefore which css to load is my own work)

XML is used to store each blog posts. PHP is used to read the XML (e.g. see content/content-blog.php for an example of how this works).
