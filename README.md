# Explanation of code
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my coding abilities in HTML, PHP, CSS, XML and JavaScript.
A demo version* of this site can be viewed at http://tinorace.no-ip.org/tinorace

PHP is used to dynamically generate HTML with the advantage that bulk changes can be made to each page by only editing code once. When new content is created, only the main text for each page is required to be entered on the new page, avoiding having to repeat the header, css, etc.

PHP is also used to return sets of blog posts based on date, category, tag, etc and to generate navigatable pages of content. Good examples of PHP used can be found in the 'includes' folder.

XML is used to store each blog post. PHP is used to read the XML (e.g. see content/content-blog.php for an example of how this works).

JavaScript is also demonstrated. The Javascript calendar was orginally from a downloaded calender plugin which has been edited by myself for style and functionality, showing my ability to read others' code and adapt it. Other Javascript code (for example for determining screen size and therefore which css to load) is my own work.
